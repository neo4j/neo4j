 .
 1. Software Evaluation.
 .
 (a) License Grant. Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms
 and conditions of this Agreement, Neo4j hereby grants Licensee a
 limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
 non-exclusive license during an “Evaluation Period” commencing on the
 Effective Date and extending for the period set forth in the trial
 request form or as otherwise specified by an authorized Neo4j
 representative to use the Software on one or more Java™ Virtual
 Machines (each an “Instance”) to develop software applications (each,
 an “Application”), all solely internally and solely for evaluation
 purposes as necessary to determine the feasibility of using the
 Software. The Evaluation Period may be extended by Neo4j in writing
 (an email from Neo4j management or sales representative will
 suffice). The Software will be made available to Licensee under this
 Agreement in object code only; no source code is provided to Licensee
 under this Agreement. Without limiting any restrictions on Licensee’s
 use of the Software as set forth in Section 1(c) (Restrictions) below
 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Licensee is expressly prohibited
 from distributing any copy of the Software (whether in connection
 with an Application-based product or service or otherwise) to any
 third party.
 .
 (b) Terms. Notwithstanding the fact that Licensee may already have
 obtained a copy of the Software from Neo4j prior to the Effective
 Date for Licensee’s use under separate software license terms such as
 the AGPL, to the extent Licensee uses the Software pursuant to the
 terms of this Agreement (as evidenced by Licensee entering into this
 Agreement), Licensee’s use of the Software is solely and exclusively
 governed by the terms of this Agreement.
 .
 (c) Restrictions. Licensee may not, and will not permit or induce any
 third party to: (i) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or
 otherwise attempt to reconstruct or discover the source code,
 underlying ideas or algorithms of any components of the Software;
 (ii) alter, modify, translate, adapt in any way, or prepare any
 derivative work based upon the Software; (iii) rent, lease, network,
 loan, pledge, encumber, sublicense, sell, distribute, disclose,
 assign or otherwise transfer the Software or any copy thereof; (iv)
 use the Software in commercial timesharing, rental or other sharing
 arrangements; or (v) remove any proprietary notices from the Software
 or any related documentation or other materials furnished or made
 available hereunder. In addition, Licensee agrees to comply with all
 applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and
 regulations applicable to Licensee’s use of the Software.
 .
 (d) Proprietary Rights. Neo4j or its licensors retain all right,
 title and interest in and to the Software and related documentation
 and materials, including, without limitation, all patent, copyright,
 trademark, and trade secret rights, embodied in, or otherwise
 applicable to the Software, whether such rights are registered or
 unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may
 exist. Licensee shall not commit any act or omission, or permit or
 induce any third party to commit any act or omission inconsistent
 with Neo4j’s or its licensors’ rights, title and interest in and to
 the Software and the intellectual property rights embodied therein or
 applicable thereto. All materials embodied in, or comprising the
 Software, including, but not limited to, graphics, user and visual
 interfaces, images, code, applications, and text, as well as the
 design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, “look and
 feel”, and arrangement of the Software and its content, and the
 trademarks, service marks, proprietary logos and other distinctive
 brand features found in the Software (“Neo4j Marks”), are all owned
 by Neo4j or its licensors; Licensee is expressly prohibited from
 using the Neo4j Marks. Title to the Software shall not pass from
 Neo4j to Licensee, and the Software and all copies thereof shall at
 all times remain the sole and exclusive property of Neo4j. Licensee’s
 embedding or integration of the Software into an Application is not
 considered a derivative work. There are no implied rights or licenses
 in this Agreement. All rights are expressly reserved by Neo4j.
 .
 (e) Third Party Software. Neo4j may in its sole discretion, make
 available third party software (“Third Party Software”) embedded in,
 or otherwise provided with, the Software. Third Party Software is
 expressly excluded from the defined term “Software” as used
 throughout this Agreement. Licensee’s use of the Third Party Software
 is subject to the applicable third party license terms which can be
 viewed at www.neotechnology.com/thirdpartylicenses, and such Third
 Party Software is not licensed to Licensee under the terms of this
 Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to abide by the applicable
 license terms for the Third Party Software, then Licensee may not
 access or use the Software or the Third Party Software. Licensee is
 solely and exclusively responsible for determining if Licensee is
 permitted to use the Third Party Software in connection with any
 Application and Licensee should address any questions in this regard
 directly to the relevant Third Party Software licensor. Neo4j makes
 no representation or warranty that Licensee is entitled to use the
 Third Party Software in connection with any Application.
 .
 2. Term & Termination.
 .
 (a) Term. Subject to termination as set forth in this Section, the
 term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will
 continue until the end of the Evaluation Period, unless extended in
 writing by an authorized Neo4j representative (e-mail will suffice
 for such extension).
 .
 (b) Termination. Neo4j may terminate this Agreement immediately with
 or without notice if the Licensee breaches its obligations under this
 Agreement. Licensee may terminate this Agreement immediately by
 ceasing use of the Software.
 .
 (c) Effects of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement
 for any reason, the licenses granted under this Agreement shall
 immediately terminate and unless Licensee and Neo4j have entered into
 a subsequent commercial written license agreement governing the
 Software, Licensee shall uninstall the Software. Within ten (10)
 calendar days of such termination, each party shall destroy or return
 all confidential and/or proprietary information of the other party in
 its possession, and will not make or retain any copies of such
 information in any form, except that the receiving party may retain
 one (1) archival copy of such information solely for purposes of
 ensuring compliance with this Agreement. If Licensee has not
 un-installed the Software within five (5) days of Neo4j’s written
 notice to Licensee of such failure: (i) Neo4j shall have the right to
 invoice Licensee at list price for the number of Instances being used
 for an annual period; (ii) Licensee’s use will be subject to the
 terms and conditions of Neo4j’s then-current standard Software
 License and Services Agreement terms; and (iii) Licensee agrees to
 pay such fees in accordance with the terms of such Software License
 and Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following
 terms shall survive the termination of this Agreement, together with
 any other terms which by their nature are intended to survive such
 termination: Section 1(c) (Restrictions), 1(d) (Proprietary Rights),
 1(e) (Third Party Software), 2(c) (Effects of Termination), 3(a)
 (“Confidentiality”), 3(b) (Feedback), 4 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 5
 (Indemnification), 6 (Limitation of Liability) and 9 (General).
 .
 3. Confidentiality & Feedback.
 .
 (a) Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means any proprietary
 information received by the other party during, or prior to entering
 into, this Agreement that a party should know is confidential or
 proprietary based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure
 including, without limitation, the Software and any non-public
 technical and business information. Confidential Information does not
 include information that (a) is or becomes generally known to the
 public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by the
 receiving party; (b) is rightfully known by the receiving party at
 the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c)
 is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the
 disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (d) the receiving
 party rightfully obtains from a third party without restriction on
 use or disclosure. Licensee and Neo4j will maintain the
 confidentiality of Confidential Information. The receiving party of
 any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use
 such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to
 fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this
 Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and
 prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of the disclosing party’s
 Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes
 to protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use
 less than reasonable care. The receiving party may disclose the
 Confidential Information of the disclosing party if required by
 judicial or administrative process, provided that the receiving party
 first provides to the disclosing party prompt notice of such required
 disclosure to enable the disclosing party to seek a protective
 order. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the
 receiving party will, at the disclosing party’s option, promptly
 return or destroy (and provide written certification of such
 destruction) the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.
 .
 (b) Feedback. To the extent Licensee sends or transmits any
 communications, comments, questions, suggestions, or related
 materials to Neo4j, whether by letter, e-mail, telephone, or
 otherwise (“Feedback”) suggesting or recommending changes to the
 Software, including, without limitation, new features or
 functionality relating thereto, Licensee hereby grants Neo4j a
 perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid-up,
 fully-transferable, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense
 through multiple tiers of sublicensees) under Licensee’s and its
 licensors’ intellectual property rights to reproduce, prepare
 derivative works of, distribute, perform, display, and otherwise
 fully use, practice and exploit such Feedback for any purpose
 whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing,
 having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and selling, directly or
 indirectly, products and services using such Feedback. Licensee
 agrees and understands that Neo4j is not obligated to use, display,
 reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or
 techniques contained in the Feedback, and Licensee has no right to
 compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.
 .
 4. Limited Development Support and Disclaimer of Warranties. Neo4j
 may elect in its sole discretion to provide You with limited
 development support on the use of the Software during Neo4j’s
 standard business hours. I) THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE ON
 AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITH ANY AND ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND; AND (II) NEO4J EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS,
 WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR
 OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY
 QUALITY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. NEO4J DOES NOT
 WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT
 THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR
 THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. LICENSEE EXPRESSLY
 ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND ALL RESULTS
 OF SUCH USE IS SOLELY AT LICENSEE’S OWN RISK. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN
 INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NEO4J OR ITS AUTHORIZED
 REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE
 SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 AND/OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, OR ALLOW
 LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE
 LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN SUCH EVENT,
 NEO4J’S WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND
 SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW IN SUCH JURISDICTION.
 .
 5. Indemnification.
 .
 (a) Indemnification. Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
 hold harmless Neo4j and its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries,
 licensors, and third party service providers, and its and their
 respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
 and contractors (each, a “Neo4j Party”), from and against any and all
 liability and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees
 and costs) incurred by any Neo4j Party in connection with any actual
 or alleged claim arising out of, or relating to: (i) Licensee’s
 breach of this Agreement, any license applicable to the Third Party
 Software, or any applicable law, rule or regulation and (ii)
 Licensee’s gross negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation or willful
 misconduct.
 .
 (b) Procedure. Counsel Licensee selects for the defense or settlement
 of a claim must be consented to by Neo4j prior to counsel being
 engaged to represent any Neo4j Party. Licensee and Licensee’s counsel
 will cooperate as fully as reasonably required, and provide such
 information as reasonably requested, by Neo4j in the defense or
 settlement of any claim. Neo4j reserves the right, at its own
 expense, to assume the exclusive defense or settlement, and control
 of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by
 Licensee. Licensee shall not in any event, consent to any judgment,
 settlement, attachment, or lien, or any other act adverse to the
 interests of any Neo4j Party without the prior written consent of
 each relevant Neo4j Party.
 .
 6. Limitation of Liability.
 .
 (a) Consequential Damages Waiver. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHALL ANY
 NEO4J PARTY BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
 LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS
 INFORMATION AND THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE
 AND/OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY
 UPON WHICH ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED AND EVEN IF A NEO4J
 PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 (b) Limitation of Damages. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO
 EVENT SHALL THE NEO4J PARTIES’ TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE
 OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION
 (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT
 LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
 DOLLARS ($250.00).
 .
 (c) Liability for Third Party Software. IF ANY LIABILITY ATTACHES TO
 ANY NEO4J PARTY IN RESPECT OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SUCH LIABILITY
 WILL BE LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 6 AND THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
 SET FORTH IN SECTION 4 (DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES) ABOVE.
 .
 (d) Failure of Essential Purpose. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THESE
 LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LIMITED REMEDY
 SPECIFIED HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
 PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
 OF INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
 LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN SUCH EVENT,
 THE LIABILITY OF THE NEO4J PARTIES FOR SUCH DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO
 THE SOFTWARE AND CONSULTING SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST
 EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN SUCH JURISDICTION. The sections
 of this Agreement that address indemnification, limitation of
 liability and the disclaimer of warranties allocate the risk between
 the parties. This allocation of risk is an essential element of the
 basis of the bargain between the parties.
 .
 7. Government Rights. The Software licensed to Licensee under this
 Agreement is “commercial computer software” as that term is described
 in DFAR 252.227-7014(a)(1). If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian
 agency, the U.S. Government acquires this commercial computer
 software and/or commercial computer software documentation subject to
 the terms of this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
 (Computer Software) and 12.11 (Technical Data) of the Federal
 Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) and its successors. If acquired by or
 on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the
 U.S. Government acquires this commercial computer software and/or
 commercial computer software documentation subject to the terms of
 this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 of the DOD FAR
 Supplement and its successors.
 .
 8. Export. Licensee acknowledges that the laws and regulations of the
 United States of America and foreign jurisdictions may restrict the
 export and re-export of certain commodities and technical data of
 United States of America origin, including the Software. Licensee
 agrees that it will comply with all export control laws and
 regulations.
 .
 9. General. This Agreement will be construed and enforced in all
 respects in accordance with the laws of the state of California,
 without reference to its choice of law rules. Except as set forth
 below in this Section, the federal and state courts seated in San
 Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, California, will have
 sole and exclusive jurisdiction for all purposes in connection with
 any action or proceeding that arises from, or relates to, this
 Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any objection to
 such exclusive jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this
 Agreement to the contrary, Neo4j may seek injunctive or other
 equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect
 any actual or threatened misappropriation or infringement of its
 intellectual property rights or those of its licensors, and Licensee
 hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and
 waives any objection thereto on the basis of improper venue,
 inconvenience of the forum or any other grounds. Licensee agrees that
 any breach of the license restrictions or other infringement or
 misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of Neo4j or its
 licensors will result in immediate and irreparable damage to Neo4j
 for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in its
 entirety is expressly excluded from this Agreement, including,
 without limitation, application to the Software provided
 hereunder. Furthermore, this Agreement (including without limitation,
 the Software provided hereunder) will not be governed or interpreted
 in any way by referring to any law based on the Uniform Computer
 Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any other act derived from or
 related to UCITA. Licensee consents to receive communications from
 Neo4j electronically, including by e-mail. Licensee agrees that all
 agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Neo4j
 provides to Licensee electronically satisfy any legal requirement
 that such communications be in writing, to the extent permitted by
 applicable law. Licensee shall not assign this Agreement or transfer
 any of its rights hereunder, or delegate the performance of any of
 its duties or obligations arising under this Agreement, whether by
 merger, acquisition, sale of assets, operation of law, or otherwise,
 without the prior written consent of Neo4j. Any purported assignment
 in violation of the preceding sentence is null and void. Subject to
 the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the
 benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties thereto. Except
 as otherwise specified in this Agreement, this Agreement may be
 amended or supplemented only by a writing that refers explicitly to
 this Agreement and that is signed on behalf of both parties. No
 waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce rights. No
 waiver will be effective unless in a writing signed on behalf of the
 party against whom the waiver is asserted. If any term of this
 Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable that term will be
 enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of
 this Agreement will remain in full force. The parties are independent
 contractors and nothing contained herein shall be construed as
 creating an agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise
 between the parties. This Agreement represents the entire agreement
 between the parties relating to its subject matter and supersedes all
 prior and/or contemporaneous representations, discussions,
 negotiations and agreements, whether written or oral, except to the
 extent Neo4j makes any software or other products and services
 available to Licensee under separate written terms. This Agreement
 shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or
 remedies on any third parties, except that each Neo4j Party shall be
 a third party beneficiary hereunder and accordingly, shall be
 entitled to directly enforce and rely upon any provision of this
 Agreement that confers a right or remedy in favor of it.
