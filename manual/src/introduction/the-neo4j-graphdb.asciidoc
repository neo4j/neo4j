[[graphdb-neo4j]]
The Neo4j Graph Database
========================

This chapter goes into more detail on the data model and behavior of Neo4j.

[[graphdb-neo4j-nodes]]
== Nodes ==

The fundamental units that form a graph are nodes and relationships.
In Neo4j, both nodes and relationships can contain <<graphdb-neo4j-properties,properties>>.

Nodes are often used to represent _entities,_ but depending on the domain relationships may be used for that purpose as well.

Apart from properties and relationships, nodes can also be <<graphdb-neo4j-labels,labeled>> with zero or more labels.

["dot", "graphdb-nodes-overview.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Node" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"A Node" -> "Relationships" [label="can have"]
"A Node" -> "Properties" [label="can have"]
"A Node" -> "Labels" [label="can have"]
"Relationships" -> "Properties" [label="can have"]
----

Let's start out with a really simple graph, containing only a single node with one property:

["dot", "graphdb-nodes.svg"]
----
"name: Peter"
----


[[graphdb-neo4j-relationships]]
== Relationships ==

Relationships between nodes are a key part of a graph database.
They allow for finding related data.
Just like nodes, relationships can have <<graphdb-neo4j-properties,properties>>.

["dot", "graphdb-rels-overview.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Relationship" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"A Relationship" -> "Start node" [label="has a"]
"A Relationship" -> "End node" [label="has a"]
"A Relationship" -> "Relationship type" [label="has a"]
"A Relationship" -> "Properties" [label="can have"]
"Relationship type" -> Name [label="uniquely identified by"]
----

A relationship connects two nodes, and is guaranteed to have valid start and end nodes.

["dot", "graphdb-rels.svg"]
----
graph [rankdir="LR"]
"Start node" -> "End node" [label="relationship"]
----

As relationships are always directed, they can be viewed as outgoing or incoming relative to a node, which is useful when traversing the graph:

["dot", "graphdb-rels-dir.svg"]
----
graph [rankdir="LR"]
START [label=""]
MIDDLE [label="Node" fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
END [label=""]
MIDDLE -> END [label="outgoing relationship"]
START -> MIDDLE [label="incoming relationship"]
----

'Relationships are equally well traversed in either direction.'
This means that there is no need to add duplicate relationships in the opposite direction (with regard to traversal or performance).

While relationships always have a direction, you can ignore the direction where it is not useful in your application.

Note that a node can have relationships to itself as well:

["dot", "graphdb-rels-loop.svg"]
----
"Node" -> "Node" [label="loop"]
----

To further enhance graph traversal all relationships have a relationship type.
Note that the word _type_ might be misleading here, you could rather think of it as a _label_.
The following example shows a simple social network with two relationship types.

["dot", "graphdb-rels-twitter.svg"]
----
Maja -> Oscar [label="follows"]
Oscar -> Maja [label="follows"]
Alice -> Oscar [label="follows"]
Oscar -> William [label="blocks" color="EDGEHIGHLIGHT" fontcolor="EDGEHIGHLIGHT"]
----

| get who a person follows | outgoing +follows+ relationships, depth one
| get the followers of a person | incoming +follows+ relationships, depth one
| get who a person blocks | outgoing +blocks+ relationships, depth one
| get who a person is blocked by | incoming +blocks+ relationships, depth one
|========================================================


[[graphdb-neo4j-properties]]
== Properties ==

Both nodes and relationships can have properties.

Properties are key-value pairs where the key is a string.
Property values can be either a primitive or an array of one primitive type.
For example +String+, +int+ and +int[]+ values are valid for properties.

[NOTE]
+NULL+ is not a valid property value.
++NULL++s can instead be modeled by the absence of a key.

["dot", "graphdb-properties.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Property" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"A Property" -> Key [label="has a"]
Key -> Primitive:String [label="is a"]
"A Property" -> Value [label="has a"]
Value -> Primitive [label="can be a"]
Value -> Primitive [label="can be an array of"]
Primitive [shape="record" label="Primitive |{boolean|byte|short|int|long|float|double|char|<String>String}"]

[[graphdb-neo4j-labels]]
== Labels ==

A label is a named graph construct that is used to group nodes into sets; all nodes labeled with the same label belongs to the same set.
Many database queries can work with these sets instead of the whole graph, making queries easier to write and more efficient.
A node may be labeled with any number of labels, including none, making labels an optional addition to the graph.

["dot", "graphdb-labels.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Label" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"A Label" -> "Name" [label="has a"]
"A Label" -> "Node" [label="groups"]
----

Labels are used when defining contraints and adding indexes for properties.

An example would be a label named +User+ that you label all your nodes representing users with.
With that in place, you can ask Neo4j to perform operations only on your user nodes, such as finding all users with a given name.

However, you can use labels for much more.
For instance, since labels can be added and removed during runtime, they can be used to mark temporary states for your nodes.
You might create an +Offline+ label for phones that are offline, a +Happy+ label for happy pets, and so on.

=== Label names ===

Any non-empty unicode string can be used as a label name.
In Cypher, you may need to use the backtick (++`++) syntax to avoid clashes with Cypher identifier rules.
By convention, labels are written with CamelCase notation, with the first letter in upper case.
For instance, +User+ or +CarOwner+.

Labels have an id space of an int, meaning the maximum number of labels the database can contain is roughly 2 billion.

[[graphdb-neo4j-paths]]
== Paths ==

A path is one or more nodes with connecting relationships, typically retrieved as a query or traversal result.

["dot", "graphdb-path.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Path" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"A Path" -> "Start Node" [label="has a"]
"A Path" -> "Relationship" [label="can contain one or more"]
"Relationship" -> "Node" [label="accompanied by a"]
"A Path" -> "End Node" [label="has an"]
----

The shortest possible path has length zero and looks like this:

["dot", "graphdb-path-example1.svg"]
----
"Node"
----

A path of length one:

["dot", "graphdb-path-example2.svg"]
----
"Node 1" -> "Node 2" [label="Relationship 1"]
----

Another path of length one:

["dot", "graphdb-path-example-loop.svg"]
----
"Node 1" -> "Node 1" [label="Relationship 1"]
----

[[graphdb-neo4j-traversal]]
== Traversal ==

Traversing a graph means visiting its nodes, following relationships according to some rules.
In most cases only a subgraph is visited, as you already know where in the graph the interesting nodes and relationships are found.

Cypher provides a declarative way to query the graph powered by traversals and other techniques.
See <<cypher-query-lang>> for more information.

Neo4j comes with a callback based traversal API which lets you specify the traversal rules.
At a basic level there's a choice between traversing breadth- or depth-first.

For an in-depth introduction to the traversal framework, see <<tutorial-traversal>>.
For Java code examples see <<tutorials-java-embedded-traversal>>.

[[graphdb-neo4j-schema]]
== Schema ==

Neo4j is a schema-optional graph database. You can use Neo4j without any schema.  Optionally you can introduce it in
order to gain performance or modeling benefits. This allows a way of working where the schema does not get in your way
until you are at a stage where you want to reap the benefits of having one.

[NOTE]
Schema commands can only be applied on the master machine in a Neo4j cluster (see <<ha>>).
If you apply them on a slave you will receive a `Neo.ClientError.Transaction.InvalidType` error code. (see <<status-codes>>)

[[graphdb-neo4j-schema-indexes]]
=== Indexes ===

NOTE: This feature was introduced in Neo4j 2.0, and is not the same as the legacy indexes (see <<indexing>>).

Performance is gained by creating indexes, which improve the speed of looking up nodes in the database.
Once youâ€™ve specified which properties to index, Neo4j will make sure your indexes are kept up to date as your graph evolves.
Any operation that looks up nodes by the newly indexed properties will see a significant performance boost.

Indexes in Neo4j are _eventually available_. That means that when you first create an index, the operation returns immediately.
The index is _populating_ in the background and so is not immediately available for querying.
When the index has been fully populated it will eventually come _online_. That means that it is now ready to be used in queries.

If something should go wrong with the index, it can end up in a _failed_ state. When it is failed, it will not be used
to speed up queries. To rebuild it, you can drop and recreate the index. Look at logs for clues about the failure.

You can track the status of your index by asking for the index state through the API you are using.
Note, however, that this is not yet possible through Cypher.

NOTE: Each index can hold a maximum of _2 billion entries_.

How to use indexes in the different APIs:

* Cypher: <<query-schema-index>>
* REST API: <<rest-api-schema-indexes>>
* Listing Indexes via Shell: <<shell-listing-indexes-and-constraints>>
* Java Core API: <<tutorials-java-embedded-new-index>>

[[graphdb-neo4j-schema-constraints]]
=== Constraints ===

NOTE: This feature was introduced in Neo4j 2.0.

Neo4j can help you keep your data clean. It does so using constraints, that allow you to specify the rules for what
your data should look like. Any changes that break these rules will be denied.

In this version, unique constraints is the only available constraint type.

How to use constraints in the different APIs:

* Cypher: <<query-constraints>>
* REST API: <<rest-api-schema-constraints>>
* Listing Constraints via Shell: <<shell-listing-indexes-and-constraints>>
