                               AsciiDoc ChangeLog

   version 8.6.7, 17 March 2012
     __________________________________________________________________

1. Version 8.6.7 (2012-03-17)

   Release highlights
   No major enhancements but quite a few bug fixes which, among other
   things, fixes Jython compatibility and improves Windows compatibility.

   All additions and changes
     * Vim syntax highlighter: highlight entity refs in macro arguments.
     * Added files with .asciidoc extension to Vim file type detection.
       [1]Patch submitted by Dag Wiers.
     * Added replacement3 substitution to enable [2]ODT whitespace
       processing.
     * Added unbreakable option to XHTML and HTML 5 backends.
     * Implemented toc::[] block macro and toc-placement attribute for
       HTML backends to allow the Table of Contents placement to be set
       manually by the author.
     * Added FAQs: How can I control page breaks when printing HTML
       outputs? and Is it possible to reposition the Table of Contents in
       HTML outputs?.
     * Added --backend and --backend-opts options to the a2x command to
       allow a2x to use backend plugin code extensions. [3]Patch submitted
       by Lex Trotman.
     * Added [4]args block attribute to source highlight blocks to allow
       arbitrary parameters to be passed to the source highlighters.
     * If the ascii-ids attribute is defined then non-ascii characters in
       auto-generated IDs [5]are replaced by their nearest ascii
       equivalents (to work around DocBook processor limitations).
     * Added global blockname attribute which is dynamically updated to
       identify the current block. See [6]discussion list.
     * xhtml11, html5 backends: Include book part TOC entries for
       multi-part books. Patch submitted by Loïc Paillotin.
     * Removed code filter example from the AsciiDoc User Guide so that
       backends implemented as external plugins can compile the manual.
       See [7]discussion list.
     * If the delimited block skip option is set then do not consume block
       title and attributes. This makes it possible for the comment
       delimited blocks to use an attribute list (previously the comment
       delimited block was hardwired to skip preceding attributes and
       titles). See [8]discussion list.
     * Added backend-confdir intrinsic attribute.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: slidy backend: broken stylesheet attribute. [9]Patch
       submitted by Micheal Hackett.
     * FIXED: Restored [10]missing themes to zip file distribution
       archive.
     * FIXED: Grammatical error in error messages. [11]Patch submitted by
       Dag Wieers.
     * FIXED: Use configured normal substitution in preference to the
       default one.
     * FIXED: The eval block macro would execute multiple times if it
       evaluated to None.
     * FIXED: Duplicated entries in TOC of large document. [12]Patch
       submitted by Sebastien Helleu.
     * FIXED: Python 2.4 backward [13]incompatibility.
     * FIXED: 8.6.6 regression broke Jython compatibility. See
       [14]discussion list.
     * FIXED: Leaky file handles in a2x and music and latex filters which
       created incompatibility problems for Jython.
     * FIXED: All Python filters are executed with the same Python
       interpreter that executes the asciidoc parent (previously filters
       were hardwired to execute the python interpreter). This prevents
       [15]Python mix-ups.
     * FIXED: Microsoft Windows shelled command-line truncation that
       caused shelled commands to fail e.g. the data-uri attribute
       failure.

2. Version 8.6.6 (2011-09-04)

   Release highlights
     * The AsciiDoc plugin architecture has been enhanced, unified and
       extended:
          + Plugin commands have been added to the asciidoc(1) --backend
            option.
          + An asciidoc(1) --theme option has been implemented to specify
            a theme and to manage theme plugins.
          + A plugin build command (for creating plugins) added.
          + build, install, list and remove plugin commands are all
            recognized by asciidoc(1) --backend, --filter and --theme
            options.
     * A security update by Kenny MacDermid removes the use of eval() on
       untrusted input (to disallow code malicious execution).

   All additions and changes
     * xhtml11, html5: Made verse and quote block text darker to print
       legibly in Google Chrome browser.
     * Added plugin build command for plugin file creation.
     * Merged --help plugins back to --help manpage so it matches the
       asciidoc(1) manpage.
     * The --filter command-line option can specify the name of filters
       that will be unconditionally loaded.
     * If a filter directory contains a file named __noautoload__ then the
       filter is not automatically loaded (you can used the --filter
       command-line option to override this behavior).
     * tests: Add Italian language tests. Patch submitted by Simon
       Ruderich. See:
       [16]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/5e
       2e6f4dd740d51a
     * tests: Add tests for localized man pages. Patch submitted by Simon

       [17]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/5e
       2e6f4dd740d51a
     * If the section name is prefixed with a + character then the section
       contents is appended to the contents of an already existing
       same-named section (the default behavior is to replace the the
       section).
     * If a configuration file section named docinfo is loaded then it
       will be included in the document header. Typically the docinfo
       section name will be prefixed with a + character so that it is
       appended to (rather than replace) other docinfo sections.
     * Added {sp} intrinsic attribute for single space character. See
       [18]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/a8
       39aa01db0765d2
     * Fixed TOC and footnotes generator. Patch submitted by Will. See

       4ac5afed736987
     * The asciidoc-confdir attribute is set to the asciidoc executable
       directory if it contains global configuration files i.e. a local
       asciidoc installation.
     * asciidoc now throws an error instead of just a warning of the
       backend configuration file is not found.
     * latex filter: write MD5 file after successful PNG file generation.
       Always delete temp files irrespective of outcome.
     * Added truecolor option to LaTeX filter. Patch submitted by Michel
       Krämer. See:
       [20]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/64
       36788a10561851

       238380a1f2507a
     * Added verbose message for ifeval::[] macro evaluation.
     * Added test case for ifeval::[] evaluation.
     * Security update to remove the use of eval() on untrusted input (to
       disallow code malicious execution). Patch submitted by Kenny
       MacDermid.
     * Changed web site layout from table to CSS based. See
       [22]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/ec

       5bb7a4
     * a2x: Pass --format option value to asciidoc as a2x-format
       attribute. Patch submitted by Lex Trotman
       ([23]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/3
       e177b84bc133ca9/659796dfadad30ea?lnk=gst&q=a2x+format#659796dfadad3
       0ea).
     * Added two FAQs submitted by Lex Trotman. See:
       [24]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/16
       d3fb9672a408e7
     * html5,xhtml11: Implemented themes directory structure.
     * html5,xhtml11: Implemented asciidoc --theme management option
       (install, list, build and remove commands).
     * html5,xhtml11: A theme can now optionally include a JavaScript file
       <theme>.js
     * html5,xhtml11: If the data-uri attribute is defined then icons from
       the theme icons directory (if they exist) will be embedded in the
       generated document.

     * The asciidoc --verbose option now prints file inclusion messages.
     * xhtml11, html5: Remove necessity for separate manpage CSS files.
     * Added css-signature attribute to tests.
     * Add css-signature attribute to set a CSS signature for the
       document. Patch submitted by Peg Russell, see:

       cbf8aeb8ad6a3a
     * White background for toc2 TOC viewport so that horizontally
       scrolled content does not obscure the the TOC. Patch submitted by
       Lionel Orry, see:
       [26]http://code.google.com/p/asciidoc/issues/detail?id=8

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: Plugin install command: Delete backend directory is install
       fails.
     * FIXED: Plugin install command: Fixed bug extracting binary files on
       Windows (reported by Jean-Michel Inglebert).
     * FIXED: tests: Skip blank sections in testasciidoc.conf test
       configuration file instead of throwing an exception (reported by
       Jean-Michel Inglebert).
     * FIXED: If a plugin Zip file does not contain file permissions
       (probably because it was created under Windows) then install it
       using the default permissions.
     * FIXED: Fixed missing quote in preceding LaTeX filter patch. Fix
       submitted by Simon Ruderich. See:
       [27]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/64
       36788a10561851
     * FIXED: Some path attributes were processed as escaped Python
       strings which could result in corrupted path names with backslash
       separated Windows path names. Reported by Will. See:
       [28]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/e8
       f3938bcb4c8bb4/44d13113a35738ef

3. Version 8.6.5 (2011-05-20)

   Release highlights
     * The addition of an html5 backend to generate HTML 5 output. Apart
       from the inclusion of audio and video block macros the html5
       backend is functionally identical to the xhtml11 backend.
     * A new flask theme for xhtml11 and html5 backends inspired by the
       [32]Flask website styling (see toc2 example in the next item
       below).
     * The new toc2 attribute generates a table of contents in the left
       hand margin (xhtml11 and html5 backends). [33]This example was
       generated using the following command:
  asciidoc -b html5 -a icons -a toc2 -a theme=flask article.txt
     * a2x(1) now has a flexible mechanism for copying arbitrary resource
       files to HTML based outputs — this is very handy for generating
       EPUB files with embedded fonts and other resources.
          + The a2x(1) --resource option can be used to inject any file
            into EPUB output documents e.g. CSS resources such as fonts
            and background images.
          + Explicitly specified resources are added to the EPUB OPF
            manifest automatically.
          + You can explicitly specify file extension MIME types.
          + The enhanced resource processing works around a couple of
            DocBook XSL bugs (see [34]EPUB Notes).

   All additions and changes
     * A new flask theme for xhtml11 and html5 backends. A shameless
       knock-off of the [35]Flask website styling.
     * Added HTML 5 article with toc2 table of contents to the example on
       the AsciiDoc website home page.
     * Added filters and topics help topics. Fixed documentation errors in
       help text. Patch submitted by Lionel Orry, see:
       [36]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/9d
       a9d48a6461ff14
     * Pass parent configuration files, command-line attributes and header
       attributes to table asciidoc filters. Based on patch submitted by
       Simon Ruderich, see:
       [37]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/5c
       792cbb395b753b
     * Allow a title attribute entry in the document header so that HTML
       backends can set the title element separately from the displayed
       document title (the doctitle attribute).
     * Pass lang attribute to asciidoc table style filter. Patch submitted
       by Simon Ruderich, see:
       [38]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/e2
       100b7cb29283ce
     * xhtml11,html5: Added toc2 attribute which generates a scrollable
       table of contents in the left hand margin. Based on customized CSS
       written by Suraj Kurapati, see
       [39]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c5
       e30ee5555877f5
     * Added asciidoc-confdir intrinsic attribute which expands to the
       global conf directory.
     * Documented that you can specify multiple CSS files with the a2x(1)
       --stylesheet command option. See:
       [40]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/ba
       f3218551d05a05
     * Improved xhtml11 backend’s table of contents generation latency.
       Patch submitted by Hongli Lai. See:
       [41]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/5a
       7fe64fbfd65ad
     * Added html5 backend.
     * For consistency converted all DOS formatted configuration and text
       files to UNIX format.
     * html4: Added ability to use role attribute with most block
       elements. Patch contributed by Simon Ruderich. See
       [42]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/56
       20ba634fdb030a
     * Added Dutch language configuration file and accompanying test file
       (contributed by Dag Wieers, see
       [43]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/f9
       69b9ce987d7f5d).
     * Configuration files are loaded in two passes when the -e
       command-line option is used (the same behavior as when the -e
       option is not used). Patch submitted by haad. See
       [44]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/cd
       0f47495fd04181 and
       [45]http://code.google.com/p/asciidoc/issues/detail?id=6&q=label%3A
       Priority-Medium
     * Documented how to include embedded fonts in an EPUB document.
     * a2x: Added .<ext>=<mimetype> resource specifier syntax.
     * a2x: Enable admonition icons in example EPUBs.
     * a2x: allow environment variables and tilde home directories in
       resource manifest files.
     * a2x: don’t process non-existent resource directories.
     * a2x: assume resource option is a directory if the name ends with a
       directory separator.
     * a2x: Added a new syntax to the --resource option specifier which
       allows the destination path to be specified.
     * a2x: Copy resources referenced in the OPF and resources referenced
       by the generated HTML (in theory DocBook XSL should ensure they are
       identical but this is not always the case e.g.
       [46]http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=373747&aid=285
       4075&group_id=21935).
     * Drop border from callout list image links.
     * html4: Moved manpage NAME section out of header so that the name
       section is rendered when the asciidoc(1) --no-header-footer option
       is specified (so that manpages processed blogpost include the NAME
       section).
     * Vim syntax highlighter: TODO markers now appear in list items and
       literal paragraphs and blocks.
     * Constrained quotes can now be bounded on the left by a } character.
       See:
       [47]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/b2
       4cc3362f35b801
     * Added text-decoration roles (underline, overline, line-through,
       blink) for xhtml11 and html5 outputs.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: epubcheck 1.1 previously issued a warning for files not
       registered in the manifest (epubcheck 1.0.5 did not). This resulted
       in a problem compiling the adventures-of-sherlock-holmes.txt
       example (the underline.png resource was not in the manifest).
     __________________________________________________________________

4. Version 8.6.4 (2011-02-20)

   Additions and changes
     * Added text foreground and background color along with text size CSS

       attribute lists.
     * Attribute entries can be used to set configuration markup
       templates.
     * Double-width East Asian characters in titles now correctly match

5. Version 8.6.3 (2010-11-14)

   Additions and changes
     * Added and unbreakable option to bulleted and numbered lists (thanks
       to Henrik Maier for this patch).
     * Added ifeval::[] system macro (thanks to Henrik Maier for
       suggesting this feature).

       work. Based on patch submitted by Henrik Maier.
     * a2x: Do not inject xsltproc parameters if they were specified on
       the command-line (parameter double-ups generate xsltproc Global
       parameter already defined errors).
     * a2x: Refactored xsltproc parameter injection.
     * a2x: articles chunked at section level by default.
     * attributes, titles and specialcharacters sections are now read from
       the local asciidoc.conf file before the header is parsed. This
       fixes a regression problem. See
       [59]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/1b
       3f88f1f8118ab3
     * Document header attributes take precedence over configuration file
       attributes.
     * Refactored music, graphviz and latex filter configurations.

       source style.
     * Separated paragraph styles from paragraph syntax — any style can be
       applied to any syntax.
     * Added listing and quote paragraph styles.
     * Renamed paragraph default style to normal.
     * Updated --help option text.
     * a2x: The asciidoc_opts, dblatex_opts, fop_opts and xsltproc_opts
       command-line options can be specified multiple times. This makes
       embedding multiple a2x options in document headers easier to manage
       and less error prone.
     * Added ASCIIMathML and LaTeXMathML support to slidy backend.
     * Pass the encoding attribute to the Pygments source highlight filter
       command.
     * a2x: HTML Help .hhk file named after AsciiDoc source file.
     * a2x: Added --xsl-file option to allow custom XSL stylesheets to be
       specified.

     * FIXED: Broken --no-conf option (8.6.2 regression).
     * FIXED: Regression in 8.6.2: configuration attribute entries set in

6. Version 8.6.2 (2010-10-03)

   Additions and changes
     * docbook45: Enclosed bibliographic lists in a bibliodiv — you can
       now include block titles with bibliographic lists.
     * Added optional keywords, description and title document header
       meta-data attributes to HTML backends for SEO.
     * AttributeEntry values can span multiple lines with a ' +' line

       [66]https://phillordbio-asciidoc-fixes.googlecode.com/hg/).
     * Implemented OpenBlock partintro style for book part introductions.
     * Comment lines substitute special characters only.
     * Backend specific global configuration files (all except

       children.
     * xhtml11: refactored CSS font-family rules to start of file.
     * xhtml11: list bullets colored gray.

       See:
       [67]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c1
       4a4c3b1e4f6dc5
     * Added two more docinfo attributes docinfo1 and docinfo2 to allow
       and control inclusion of a shared docinfo file. See
       [68]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c9
       48697943432e24
     * Vim syntax highlighter highlights multi-name conditional
       attributes.
     * LaTeX backend patch submitted by Andreas Hermann Braml (see
       [69]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/1c

     * Implemented backend aliases; renamed docbook.conf to docbook45.conf
       and aliased docbook45 backend to docbook; aliased xhtml11 to html.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: Filter commands located in filter directories local to the
       source document that where not in the search PATH where not found.
     * FIXED: Volnitsky theme: Verseblock font set normal instead of
       monospaced.
     * FIXED: xhtml11: Callout icons were not rendered as Data URIs when
       icons and data-uri attributes were specified.
     * FIXED: Long standing bug: nested include macros did not restore the
       parent document infile and indir attributes. See:
       [70]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/87
       12a95e95a292a7

       if x or y is undefined.
     * FIXED: latex filter not being installed by Makefile. Thanks to
       Grant Edwards for this patch. See
       [71]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c4

7. Version 8.6.1 (2010-08-22)

   Additions and changes
     * a2x: --resource-dir option renamed to --resource.
     * a2x: --resource option accepts both file and directory names.
     * a2x: Added -m,--resource-manifest option.
     * Added Vim syntax highlighting for quote attribute lists.
     * Load asciidoc.conf from all configuration directories before any
       other configuration files. This ensures that attributes used for
       conditional inclusion are set before backend configuration files
       are processed. Previously if you wanted to control global conf file
       inclusion your only choice was to modify the global asciidoc.conf
       file.
     * AsciiDoc Quote element attributes have been simplified and
       generalized — positional color and size attributes and named role
       attribute have been replaced by a single positional attribute.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: testasciidoc.py: BACKEND command argument was being ignored.
     * FIXED: Broken docinfo file functionality in html4 and xhtml11
       backends (previously the docinfo file was included in the body
       instead of the header).

  7.1. Regression issues

   This release breaks compatibility with quoted element positional color
   and size attributes (HTML backends). To revert to the deprecated quote
   behavior define the deprecated-quotes attribute in the global
   asciidoc.conf file or on the command-line. For a more detailed
   explanation of the rationale behind this change see
   [73]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/b22603
   bfb879418c.
     __________________________________________________________________

8. Version 8.6.0 (2010-08-16)

   Additions and changes
     * The AsciiDoc distribution can now be built “out of the box” from
       the distribution tarball or the Mercurial repository (provided you
       have the requisite build applications installed).
     * The global configuration files directory is ignored by both
       asciidoc and a2x if AsciiDoc configuration files are installed in
       the same directory as the asciidoc executable. This change allows
       both a system wide copy and multiple local copies of AsciiDoc to
       coexist on the same host PC.
     * CSS quirks mode is no longer the default xhtml11 output
       ([74]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/1
       c02d27d49221aa2).
     * Relaxed anchor ID name syntax
       ([75]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/5
       f3e825c74ed30c).
     * Added document files: doc/epub-notes.txt,
       doc/publishing-ebooks-with-asciidoc.txt.
     * a2x: If all other resource locations are exhausted then recursively
       search directories named images and stylesheets in the asciidoc
       configuration files directory.
     * a2x: options can also be set in the AsciiDoc source file. If the
       source file contains a line beginning with // a2x: then the
       remainder of the line will be treated as a2x command-line options.
     * Added dblatex table-width processing instruction — tables generated
       by dblatex now observe the AsciiDoc table width as a percentage
       (thanks to Gustav Broberg for suggesting this enhancement).
     * a2x: Don’t exit if the --epubcheck option is set and epubcheck is
       missing, issue warning and continue.
     * Added a global plaintext attribute for dealing with large amounts
       of imported text.
     * The author name format has been relaxed, if the the author does not
       match the formal specification then it is assigned to the firstname
       attribute (previously asciidoc exited with an error message).
     * FAQ and documentation updates.
     * Refactored chunked.xsl and epub.xsl files.
     * Exchanged article.epub for more relevant book.epub on website.
     * Put asciidoc.epub User Guide on website.
     * a2x: Chunking EPUB and HTML outputs set to a per chapter basis and
       the first chapter is separate from preceding contents.
     * Changed dates format in example article and books to suppress EPUB
       validation error.
     * Added style and role CSS classes to xhtml11 section templates.
     * Added the role element to xhtml11 backend block templates.
     * Suppressed md5 module deprecation warning from music and Graphviz
       filters.
     * Pygments ([76]http://pygments.org/) option added to source code
       highlight filter. Based on Pygments source code filter written by
       David Hajage
       ([77]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/d
       8d042f5a3021369/8934ebbb8cb7144b).
     * xhtml11: Added a new theme (volnitsky). Written and contributed by
       Leonid V. Volnitsky.
     * xhtml11: Set body element class name to document type.
     * Added refentryinfo element and contents (including revdate) to man
       page DocBook output. Man pages are now dated using the revdate
       attribute value if it has been defined. Based on patch supplied by
       Rainer Muller
       [78]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/319e5
       cd94493e330/3fcb83fab067af42.
     * Added {template:...} system attribute.
     * Table of contents attribute toc can now be specified in the
       document header.
     * Reimplemented music and latex filter -m option functionality when
       the input is stdin using MD5 checksums.
     * Added latex filter.
     * Added auto file name generation to image generating filters
       (latex,music, graphviz).
     * Added counter2 and set2 system attributes (to implement image auto
       file name generation).
     * Undefined attribute in filter command generates error but does not
       exit.
     * Attribute substitution proceeds from start line to end line
       (previously was in reverse order which was really confusing).
     * Tidied up music filter code:
          + Format option is optional and default to abc unless Lilypond
            notation detected.
          + The -m option does not apply to stdin input.
     * Added paragraph styles to music and graphviz filters.
     * Documented dynamic template names. 753: Graphviz filter can now
       generate SVG format images. Patch submitted by Elmo Todurov, see:
       [79]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/fe9b3
       3d8f5f1e0af The xhtml11 SVG Graphviz template marked EXPERIMENTAL.
       No SVG support for other backends.
     * AsciiDoc template names can now contain embedded attribute
       references.
     * Added legalnotice tag to doc/article-docinfo.xml example.
     * xhtml11 backend: Callouts and callout lists display callout icons
       when the icons attribute is defined. See
       [80]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/8eda3
       ea812968854
     * Document attribute names are case insensitive everywhere, this
       makes using attribute entries more consistent e.g. previously
       :VERS: had to be refered to
     * Hungarian translation of footer-text (submitted by Miklos Vajna).
       See
       [81]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/7174c
       b7598993c72#

       See
       [82]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/66e7b
       59d12cd2f91 Based on patch submitted by Phillip Lord.
     * German translation of footer-text (submitted by Simon Ruderich).

       [83]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/7174c
       b7598993c72
     * Pushed HTML footer text into language conf files with the
       introduction of a [footer-text] configuration file template
       section. See
       [84]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/7174c
       b7598993c72

   Bug fixes

       paragraph were mistakenly seen as starting with an inline literal.
       See
       [85]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/219c8
       6ae25b79a21
     * FIXED: localtime and doctime attributes calculated incorrect
       daylight saving / non daylight saving timezones and consequently so
       did HTML footers. Patch submitted by Slawomir Testowy. See
       [86]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/af652
       507caf6cec9

       aligned. Submitted by Lionel Orry. See
       [89]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/2ff80
       2547b6a75ea
     * FIXED: Filter execution now occurs prior to filter markup template
       substitution to ensure image data URI encoding happens after image
       generation (see
       [90]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/14
       e8fcb289a135b).
     * FIXED: The section numbers no longer increment when the numbered
       attribute is undefined (see
       [91]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/fa
       a36e9e5c7da019/d24cab3fe363e58d).

     * The eval system attribute can be nested inside other system
       attributes.
     * HTML outputs: Table and figure caption punctuation set to more
       usual syntax.
     * docbook backend: footnotes can now contain embedded images. See
       [97]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/50b28
       f6941de111a
     * CSS tweaks so that tables processed by DocBook XSL Stylesheets have
       the default asciidoc xhtml11 backend styling. See
       [98]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/dfe52
       04d5b2c9685
     * Block titles take precedence over section titles to avoid titled
       delimited blocks being mistaken for two line section titles (see
       [99]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/f0b6f
       9989f828c3).

     * Vim syntax highlighter improvements.

   Bug fixes

11. Version 8.5.1 (2009-10-31)

   Additions and changes
     * If an AsciiDoc document file begins with a UTF-8 BOM (byte order
       mark) then it is passed transparently through to the output file.

       [105]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/2aa3
       e5711d243045
     * Conditional attribute syntax extended: they now accept multiple
       ORed or ANDed attribute names.
     * The xhtml11 backend dynamically processes footnotes using
       JavaScript.
     * Tidied up and namespaced xhtml11 JavaScript.

       (just like the AttributeList element).
     * For consistency changed underscores to dashes in attribute names.
       Public attributes with underscores retained for compatibility.
     * Added Brazilian Portuguese language configuration file (contributed
       by Thiago Farina).
     * Added leveloffset attribute to make it easier to combine documents.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: a2x: --dblatex-opts is now processed last so
       asciidoc-dblatex.xsl params can be overridden. Patch submitted by
       Mark Fernandes (see
       [106]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/5215
       c99dcc865e7d).
     * FIXED: An error occurred if a directory in current path with same
       name as executable.

  11.1. Regression issues

   There’s been quite a bit of tiding up to the xhtml11 JavaScript. The
   most obvious change is that the toc.js script has been superceded by
   asciidoc-xhtml11.js so if you’re linking you’ll need get a copy of the
   new file from the distribution javascripts directory.

   If you use customised xhtml11 configuration file [header] and [footer]
   sections and you want them to use the new footnotes feature then you’ve
   got a bit more work to do:
    1. The onload event expression changed.
    2. The new <div id="content">...</div> div envelopes document content.
    3. You need to add <div id="footnotes">...</div> div to the
       [footnotes] section for footnotes to work.
    4. Drop the ifdef::toc[] macro that surround JavaScript inclusion.

   Take a look at the [header] and [footer] changes in the xhtml11.conf
   diff to see what’s going on:

12. Version 8.5.0 (2009-10-04)

   Additions and changes
     * Implemented a float attribute for tables and block images (HTML
       outputs only).
     * Added unfloat::[] block macro to cancel floating.
     * Added table align attribute to (HTML outputs only).
     * The image align attribute now works with HTML backends.
     * Renamed table cell align attribute to halign so it doesn’t clash
       with the new table align attribute.
     * Added breakable and unbreakable options to AsciiDoc example and
       block image elements.
     * [miscellaneous] section entries now update properly when set from a
       document AttributeEntry.
     * [miscellaneous] section pagewidth entry accepts fractional values.
     * Fractional column widths are now calculated correctly when using
       fractional pageunits (DocBook tables).
     * Use DocBook XSL table width processing instructions.
     * asciidoc KeyboardInterrupt exits with error code 1.
     * Added set system attribute to allow attributes to be set from
       configuration file templates.
     * Allow constrained quotes to be bounded on the left by a colons and
       semicolons, see
       [108]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/b276
       a927fdc87995
     * Titled listing and literal blocks (DocBook outputs) no longer
       default to examples. See
       [109]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/f4df
       7c9eec01a9bd
     * Updated language file table, figure and example captions to
       accommodate new auto-numbering in html4 and xhtml11 backends.
     * Titled source highlight filter listings generated by docbook
       backend are now rendered as examples. See
       [110]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/f4df
       7c9eec01a9bd
     * Implemented counter system attribute.
     * Use counter system attributes to number titled tables and block
       images in HTML backends.
     * Added program name suffix to console messages.
     * Added substitution to the AttributeEntry passthrough syntax, this
       replaces the now unnecessary attributeentry-subs attribute.
     * Allow passthrough inline macro syntax to be used in
       AttributeEntrys.
     * Reinstated 8.4.4 default lang attribute behavior. See
       [111]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/d299
       24043e21cb6a.
     * Added max-width attribute to the xhtml11 backend to set maximum
       display width. See
       [112]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/74d9
       a542b79ccd50.
     * Added a2x.py, a rewritten and much enhanced version of the old a2x
       bash script.
     * The new a2x can output EPUB formatted documents.
     * Added --safe option and deprecated --unsafe option. Patch submitted
       by Todd Zullinger. See
       [113]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/ea3a
       8ea399ae5d2a and
       [114]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/69b3
       183fdab7c6a5
     * Added CHECK and TEST todo highlight words to Vim syntax
       highlighter.
     * Line breaks, page breaks, and horizontal rulers are now processed
       by dblatex, thanks to a patch submitted by Mark Fernandes
       ([115]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/a25
       4cf949ea7c6c5).
     * Allow footnote macros hard up against the preceding word so the
       rendered footnote mark can be placed against the noted text without
       an intervening space (patch submitted by Stas Bushuev,
       [116]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/e1dc
       b7ee0efc17b5).
     * Normalized path in safe_filename function (submitted by Todd
       Zullinger,
       [117]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/69b3
       183fdab7c6a5).
     * The Asciidoc numbered and toc attributes cause DocBook outputs to
       include asciidoc-numbered and asciidoc-toc processing instructions,
       these are used by DocBook XSL to include section numbering and
       table of contents (like Asciidoc HTML backends). For backward
       compatibility both numbered and toc attributes are defined by
       default when the docbook backend is used. See
       [118]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/1bad
       ad21ff9447ac.
     * data-uri attribute is now evaluated dynamically and can be set in
       document body (previously could only be set from command-line).
     * Added sys3 and eval3 system attributes to passthrough generated
       output, this fixes the data-uri inline image problem:
       [119]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/a42d
       b6bc54c2c537.
     * Missing language file generates a warning instead of an error.
     * Updated Spanish language file (updates contributed by Gustavo
       Andrés Gómez Farhat).

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: Options in an AttributeList option attribute are merged with
       (rather than replace) configuration file options.
     * FIXED: Comment blocks and comment block macros no longer consume
       preceding block titles and attribute lists.
     * FIXED: examples/website/layout1.conf and
       examples/website/layout2.conf TOC problem. Submitted by Mark
       (burtoogle). See
       [120]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/b9c6
       3be67dd1d11c
     * FIXED: Only the first occurrence of passthrough macro was
       substituted. Patch submitted by Peter Johnson. See
       [121]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/1269
       dc2feb1a482c
     * FIXED: asciidoc now runs on Jython 2.5.0.
     * FIXED: Wordpress margins and pads in a number of block elements
       ([122]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/36f
       f073c79cbc20a).

  12.1. Regression issues

     * Tables generated by dblatex occupy 100% of the available space
       regardless of the width attribute setting. To restore width
       behavior change the pageunits miscellaneous parameter to pt. You
       can do this from the command-line with the -a pageunits=pt option.
       See [123]DocBook table widths.
     __________________________________________________________________

13. Version 8.4.5 (2009-05-24)

   Additions and changes
     * Added manpage Name and Synopsis section title customization to
       languages configuration files.
     * Synopsis manpage section no longer mandatory.
     * Section markup templates can be specified by setting the title’s
       first positional attribute or template attribute.
     * The article and book document header can now include a revision
       remark.
     * A role attribute can now be applied to block elements. This adds
       the role attribute to DocBook elements. Patch submitted by
       [124]Noah Slater).
     * Renamed revision and date attributes to more sensible and
       consistent revnumber and revdate (old names deprecated but still
       recognized).
     * Moved backend specific attributes to Appendix H in User Guide.
     * Renamed and generalized the docbook backend revision history
       inclusion mechanism to docinfo to reflect the use of all article or
       book information elements. The old revision history names still
       work but have been deprecated.
     * Refactored docbook.conf headers.
     * Moved line break replacement from [replacements] to [replacements2]
       so the replacement occurs after the mailto macro. This fixes bug
       [125]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/4
       bdcdfb0af773e2
     * The typewriter to punctuation apostrophe replacement can be escaped
       with a backslash.
     * Graphviz filter outputs images to imagesdir if it is defined.
     * Made the block image macro generic so that it can be used for
       filter outputs. As a result Music and Graphviz filters:
          + Have been greatly simplified.
          + Honor the data-uri attribute.
          + html4 outputs no longer generate W3C validation warning.
     * The iconsdir attribute no longer requires a trailing directory
       separator character.
     * Removed borders around linked html4 images.
     * Added html4 specific HTML output for music filter.
     * a2x: Added --unsafe option (shortcut for --asciidoc-opts=--unsafe).
     * a2x: The FOP executable can now be named fop (this is the default
       name in some distributions).
     * Attributes are now substituted in the system macro attribute list.
     * If the output is set to stdout (i.e. no output directory is
       defined) then Music and Graphviz filters will output included
       images to the source file directory.
     * Added name directive to testasciidoc.
     * Added lots of testasciidoc new tests.
     * Moved language specific configuration parameters into lang-en.conf
       file.
     * lang attribute entry can be specified in the AsciiDoc source file
       (preceding the header).
     * Removed cruft from A-A-P scripts and documented them.
     * Added German language config file (lang-de.conf) contributed by
       Michael Wild.
     * Added French language config file (lang-fr.conf) contributed by
       Yves-Alexis Perez.
     * Added Russian language config file (lang-ru.conf) contributed by
       Artem Zolochevskiy.
     * Added Hungarian language config file (lang-hu.conf) contributed by
       Miklos Vajna.

   Bug fixes
     * FIXED: Multiple manpage names are now handled correctly when
       generating DocBook output, each name now generates a separate
       DocBook <refname> element. See
       [126]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/c
       93bb4db025225d8
     * FIXED: A problem that caused AttributeEntries preceding the header
       to be overwritten when the language conf file loaded.
     * FIXED: Possible inline macro name ambiguity e.g. link matches
       olink.
     * FIXED: The documented macro definition deletion behavior had been
       broken for a long time.
     * FIXED: Email addresses not recognized when followed by a period
       character.
     * FIXED: Hyphens in mailto macros can delimit nested addresses e.g.
       bloggs@mail was processed inside
       mailto:joe-bloggs@mail-server.com[Mail].
     * FIXED: User name in FTP URI generated incorrect FTP link. See
       [127]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/1
       d796a9c9ddb2855
     * FIXED: Source highlighter now works with Wordpress backend (see
       [128]http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/6
       d8c716748b109e3).

  13.1. Regression issues

    1. A colon following the date in the AsciiDoc header is treated as a
       revision remark delimiter — this could be an issue if you have used
       a colon in the header date.
     __________________________________________________________________

14. Version 8.4.4 (2009-04-26)

   Additions and changes
     * Added table column and row spanning.
     * Table styles can now be applied per cell.
     * Vertical cell alignment can be applied to columns and individual
       cells.
     * Added table align attribute to set horizontal alignment for entire
       table.
     * Included Geoff Eddy’s update of the experimental LaTeX backend.
     * A new attribute named trace controls the output of diagnostic
       information. If the trace attribute is defined then
       element-by-element diagnostic messages detailing output markup
       generation are printed to stderr.
     * Added literal paragraph style (allows literal style to be applied
       to normal paragraphs).
     * Deleted unused replacements2 from xhtml11.conf.
     * Added replacements2 to default substitutions.
     * testasciidoc.py: messages to stdout, only diffs to stderr.
     * Added transparency to smallnew.png image.

   Bug fixes
     * All combinations of leading comments and attribute entries at the
       start of a document are now skipped correctly.
     * FIXED: ./configure doesn’t support --docdir as expected (patch
       submitted by Artem Zolochevskiy)
     * FIXED: Constrained quotes were incorrectly matched across line
       boundaries e.g. the string +\nabc+ incorrectly matched a monospace
       quote.
     __________________________________________________________________

15. Version 8.4.3 (2009-04-13)

   Additions and changes
     * DocBook outputs default to DocBook version 4.5 doctype (previously
       4.2).
     * Configuration file [specialsections] definitions can be undefined
       by setting their configuration entry values blank.
     * The Makefile install target depends on the all target to ensure
       pre-install patches are applied.
     * testasciidoc.py now emits user friendly messages if:
         1. the configuration file is missing.
         2. an illegal backend is specified.
         3. an illegal test number is specified.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed [129]missing template section error.
     * The testasciidoc.py --force option no longer deletes test data
       files that were not specified.
     * Dropped second quotes substitution in table cells — it had
       effectively disabled quote escaping in table cells.
     __________________________________________________________________

16. Version 8.4.2 (2009-03-19)

   Additions and changes
     * Added [130]testasciidoc, a tool to verify AsciiDoc conformance.
     * A warning is issued if nested inline passthroughs are encountered.
     * asciidocapi: setting an attribute value to None will undefine
       (delete) the attribute (this in addition to the name! attribute
       name format that the asciidoc(1) command uses).
     __________________________________________________________________

17. Version 8.4.1 (2009-03-10)

   Additions and changes
     * AsciiDoc now has a [131]Python API. The following minimal example
       compiles mydoc.txt to mydoc.html:

       from asciidocapi import AsciiDocAPI asciidoc = AsciiDocAPI()
       asciidoc.execute('mydoc.txt')

     * Backtick quoting for monospaced text is now implemented as an
       inline literal passthrough. This makes more sense since monospace
       text is usually intended to be rendered literally. See
       [132]Regression issues below for the impact this may have on
       existing documents. Here are some examples that would previously
       have had to be escaped:
  The `++i` and `++j` auto-increments.
  Paths `~/.vim` and `~/docs`.
  The `__init__` method.
  The `{id}` attribute.
     * Added --doctest option to asciidoc(1) command.
     * Added an optional second argument to BlockId element, this sets the
       {reftext} attribute which in turn is used to set the xreflabel
       attribute in DocBook elements.
     * Added lists to --help syntax summary.
     * {infile} and {indir} attributes reflect the current input file
       (previously always referred to the root document).
     * {docfile} (new) and {docdir} (previously deprecated) attributes
       refer to the root document specified on the asciidoc(1)
       command-line.
     * Vim syntax highlighter improvements.
     * Syntax summary command (asciidoc -h syntax) additions.
     * Admonition icons now have transparent backgrounds.
     * Changed yellow W3C badges to blue ones in page footers.

   Bug fixes
     * Dropped asciidoc(1) broken undocumented --profile option.
     * Em dash replacement now recognized at start of block.

  17.1. Regression issues

   Replacing backtick quoting with the inline literal passthrough raises
   two regression scenarios for existing documents:
    1. You have escaped the expansion of enclosed inline elements, for
       example: \{id}. You would need to delete the backslashes: {id} (if
       you don’t the backslashes will be printed). Mostly it’s just a case
       of interactively finding and replacing of all occurrences of `\.
    2. There are enclosed inline elements, for example: some *bold*
       monospaced. You would need to switch to plus character monospace
       quoting: +some *bold* monospaced+ (if you don’t the enclosed
       elements won’t be expanded).

   If your existing documents include these cases and you don’t want to
   upgrade then use the -a no-inline-literal command-line option,
   alternatively put this in ~/.asciidoc/asciidoc.conf:
  [attributes]
  no-inline-literal=
     __________________________________________________________________

18. Version 8.3.5 (2009-02-02)

   Additions and changes
     * Cached compiled regular expression delimiters (speed up User Manual
       compilation by 250%).
     * Created distinct list definitions for each numbered list style to
       allow nesting of all styles.
     * Roman numbers in numbered lists are followed by a closing
       parenthesis instead of a period to eliminate i, v, x item ambiguity
       with respect to alpha numbered list items.
     * Added **, ***, ****, ***** bulleted lists.
     * Added ..., ...., ..... implicit numbered lists.
     * Added :::, :::: labeled lists.
     * Updated User Guide for new list syntaxes.
     * Optimized paragraph and list termination detection with separate
       precompiled regular expressions for performance and to prevent
       reaching Python 100 named group limit.
     * Updated Vim syntax highlighter for new list syntaxes.
     * Allow template::[] macros in conf file entries sections (not just
       in template sections).
     * Dropped unused [listdef-numbered2] conf file sections.
     * Renamed ListBlock to more appropriate OpenBlock.
     * Implemented single-line versions of ifdef::[] and ifndef::[]
       macros.
     * html4 backend styling:
          + Underlined admonition captions.
          + Added side border to Example Blocks.
     * xhtml11 backend styling:
          + Dropped right hand margin from all but quote and verse blocks.
          + html4 backend: corrected over-sized width of caption in
            admonition block.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed broken numbered list nesting.

  18.1. Compatibility issues

   The roman numbered list parenthesis syntax is incompatible with the
   potentially ambiguous roman period syntax introduced in 8.3.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

19. Version 8.3.4 (2009-01-20)

   Additions and changes
     * Implemented a title float style. A floating title (or bridgehead)
       is rendered just like a normal section but is not formally
       associated with a text body and is not part of the regular section
       hierarchy so the normal ordering rules do not apply.
     * Implemented inline comment macro so comment lines can now appear
       inside block elements.
     * Comment lines are sent to the output if the showcomments attribute
       is defined (comment blocks are never sent to the output).
     * Single quoting attribute values in AttributeList elements causes
       them to be substituted like normal inline text (without single
       quoting only attribute substitution is performed).
     * Rewrote list item processing (was very crufty). List continuation
       and list blocks now work as expected. Updated and clarified list
       documentation in User Guide.
     * The revision attribute now recognizes the RCS $Id$ marker format.
     * An RCS $Id$ marker formatted revision line in the header does not
       need to be preceded by an author line.
     * If an RCS $Id$ formatted revision is specified and the author name
       has not already been set then the author name in the $Id$ marker
       will be used.
     * Updated Gouichi Iisaka’s Graphviz filter to version 1.1.3.
     * Added autowidth table attribute option for (X)HTML outputs.
     * DocBook backend now puts orgname optional attribute in DocBook
       header.
     * Deprecated undocumented companyname attribute in favor of DocBook’s
       corpname.
     * Removed explicit closing backslash from HTML4 self-closing tags to
       comply with WC3 recommendation.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed 8.3.3 regression whereby adjacent lists with the same syntax
       but different list styles were incorrectly treated as a single
       list.
     __________________________________________________________________

20. Version 8.3.3 (2009-01-02)

   This release supersedes 8.3.2.

   Bug fixes
     * The broken and confusing numeration and numeration2 numbered list
       attributes have been dropped, use the style attribute instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

21. Version 8.3.2 (2009-01-01)

   Additions and changes
     * Added Gouichi Iisaka’s Graphviz filter to distribution.
     * The SidebarBlock element can now be rendered with an abstract
       style.
     * Reorganized filters into a separate subdirectory for each filter.
     * Updated Makefile.in and MANIFEST files to reflect new filters
       organization.
     * Added listing style to LiteralBlock element so listings with nested
       listing blocks can be rendered as a listing block.
     * Changed example code filter to use preferred ListingBlock syntax
       (the old ~ delimited filter syntax is no longer used).
     * Implemented enumeration and enumeration2 numbered list attributes
       for specifying the list numbering style (arabic, loweralpha,
       upperalpha, lowerroman and upperroman).
     * AsciiDoc now recognizes upperalpha, lowerroman and upperroman
       numbers in listdef-numbered2 numbered lists and sets the number
       style based on the style of the first numbered list item
       (alternative to setting enumeration2 attribute).
     * Updated formatlistpat definition in .vimrc example in User Guide.
     * You can now backslash escape system block macros.
     * Added Pychart FAQ.
     * Drop paragraph text and list text, index and label match groups
       from attributes — they are included in the element’s text and we
       don’t want them processed a second time as attributes.
     * Changed comment line block macro to a passthrough block macro to
       ensure no substitutions.
     * A subslist no longer has to be appended to a PassthroughBlock macro
       definition, if omitted no substitutions are performed.
     * Code tidy up: replaced deprecated <> operator with !=.
     * Removed unused linuxdoc code.
     * Code tidy ups: dropped old types module reference; replaced
       has_key() with preferred in operator.

   Bug fixes
     * Old syntax source highlight filter regression: special characters
       where not escaped in DocBook outputs.
     __________________________________________________________________

22. Version 8.3.1 (2008-12-14)

   Additions and changes
     * Replaced the install.sh script with Ben Walton’s updated autoconf
       scripts — see [133]INSTALL for details.
     * Added a generalized AttributeEntry syntax to allow arbitrary
       configuration file entries to be set from within an AsciiDoc
       document (suggested by Henrik Maier).
     * Listing delimited blocks in DocBook outputs now support IDs; IDs of
       titled Listing and Literal delimited blocks have been moved to the
       enclosing DocBook example tag (thanks to Vijay Kumar for this
       patch).
     * Replaced vertical typewriter apostrophe with punctuation apostrophe
       (thanks to Noah Slater).

   Bug fixes
     * Regression: Excluding double-quotes from unquoted attribute values
       resulted in backward incompatibility, double-quotes in unquoted
       attribute values has been reinstated.
     * Regression: Text like &...; was sometimes mistaken for an entity
       reference — tightened up entity reference matching.

23. Version 8.3.0 (2008-11-29)

   Additions and changes
     * [134]AsciiDoc new tables is a complete redesign of the tables
       syntax and generation. The new syntax and features are a huge
       improvement over the old tables. The old tables syntax has been
       deprecated but is currently still processed.
     * [135]Lists can now be styled like other block elements. This allows
       a single list syntax for glossary, qanda (Question and Answer) and
       bibliography lists instead of having to remember a different syntax
       for each type.
     * Inline passthroughs macros have been improved and block passthrough
       macros added. Attribute substitution can be optionally specified
       when the macro is called.
     * The passthrough block has a fully transparent passthrough delimited
       block block style called pass.
     * The asciimath and latexmath [136]passthrough macros along with
       asciimath and latexmath [137]passthrough blocks provide a (backend
       dependent) mechanism for rendering mathematical formulas. There are
       [138]LaTeX Math, [139]AsciiMathML and [140]LaTeXMathML examples on
       the AsciiDoc website.
     * Reimplemented and cleaned up filter processing based on a patch
       submitted by Kelly Anderson. Uses the newer subprocess module
       instead of the deprecated popen2 module. Now works in Win32 command
       shell.
     * Addition FAQs, more documentation updates.
     * Arbitrary HTML/XML entities can be entered in AsciiDoc source.
     * Did away with the need for the shaded-literallayout.patch (thanks
       to Henrik Maier for this patch).
     * Implemented page break block macro.
     * Added line breaks and ruler processing instructions to DocBook
       outputs (thanks to Henrik Maier for this patch).
     * Added deg (degree) and wj (word joiner) entity attributes (thanks
       to Henrik Maier).
     * Tweaked DocBook indexterm2 macro to avoid white space preceding the
       term when used in table cells (thanks to Henrik Maier for this
       patch).
     * Title elements now process the options attribute like other block
       elements.
     * Added ‘single quoted’ element.
     * Spaces on both sides of a — em-dash are translated to thin space
       characters.
     * Improved detection and reporting of malformed attribute lists.
     * The list compact style is now a list option.
     * Added strong labeled list option which makes the labels bold (HTML
       outputs only).
     * Dropped unsupported linuxdoc backend.
     * Dropped deprecated xhtml-deprecated (version 6) backend.
     * Added breakable and unbreakable attribute options to tables to
       control table breaking across page boundaries (DocBook XSL/FO
       outputs). By and in collaboration with Henrik Maier.
     * Added pgwide attribute option to tables to table, block image,
       horizontal labeled lists. Specifies that the element should be
       rendered across the full text width of the page irrespective of the
       current indentation (DocBook XSL/FO outputs). Thanks to Henrik
       Maier for this patch.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: spaces before/after bullets no longer
       highlighted (which is ugly if using a theme that highlights with
       underlines). Thanks to Donald Chai for this patch.
     * Added a2x(1) --fop option.
     * Added a2x(1) --no-xmllint option.
     * Highlighted labelled list terms with the navy color in XHTML
       outputs.
     * Use w3m(1) as default a2x(1) text format generator (fallback to
       lynx(1)).
     * Changed callout formats in html4 and xhtml11 outputs to angle
       brackets to match source highlighter rendering.
     * Macros now inject user defined <optionname>-option attributes into
       markup.
     * Added IRC URLs to AsciiDoc inline macros.
     * Added depth attribute to include::[] system macro.
     * Added footnoteref inline macro.
     * Added stylesheet XHTML attribute to specify additional custom CSS
       stylesheet.
     * If a paragraph style is specified it will be added to the XHTML
       class attribute and DocBook role attribute.
     * Replacements can be set in a document using the reserved
       AttributeEntry name replacement.
     * The prefix for auto-generated section name IDs can be set with the
       idprefix attribute.

   Bug fixes
     * Escaped quote skipped over leading and trailing quote instead of
       just the leading quote.
     * Fixed bug that was causing false negative safe mode warnings (patch
       submitted by Julien Palmas).
     * Placed priority of AttributeEntry, AttributeList and BlockTitle
       above Title. This ensures an AttributeEntry, AttributeList or
       BlockTitle followed by a same length leading ListingBlock delimiter
       is not mistaken for a two-line title.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: fixed multi-line quoted text.
     * Contstrained quote termination after non-space character enforced.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: unterminated quoted text is no longer
       highlighted.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: passthroughs now exactly match AsciiDoc
       semantics.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: escaped quoted text, attribute references
       and inline macros are not highlighted.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: TODO’s highlighted in CommentBlocks (thanks
       to Scott Wall); non-greedy $$...$$.
     * Vim syntax highlighter: Comment lines mistaken for vertical list
       labels (thanks to Scott Wall).
     * Vim syntax highlighter: Single unmatched $$ mistakenly highlighted
       remaining text (patch contributed by Scott Wall).
     * Callouts now work in source highlighted listing generated by
       dblatex.
     * Fixed exception that occured if undefined attribute was present in
       filter command.
     * AttributeList block can now follow a paragraph without intervening
       blank line.
     * The include macro tabsize attribute is no longer propagated to
       nested includes.

   Omissions
   The following features were implemented but then but removed from this
   release:
     * pi, cdata and comment passthrough macros and passthrough block
       styles (creeping featurism, use pass macros instead).
     * Generic tag inline macro (creeping featurism, use pass macros
       instead).

  23.1. Compatibility issues

   Version 8.3.0 has a number of backward incompatibilities with respect
   to the previous 8.2.7 release:
     * The old table syntax is still processed but a DEPRECATED warning is
       issued.
     * Entity references have to be escaped with a backslash.
     * You have to explicitly precede horizontal style labeled lists with
       the [horizontal] style attribute — by default all labeled lists are
       rendered vertically.
     * The list compact style has been dropped and is now a list option
       (use options="compact" in attribute lists).
     * AsciiDoc version 6 sytnax no longer supported.
     * Linuxdoc been removed from the distribution.
     * The unsupported experimental latex backend has not been tested on
       this release.
     * The introduction of single-quote quoting requires that double-quote
       quoting is escaped with two backslashes.
     __________________________________________________________________

24. Version 8.2.7 (2008-07-04)

   Additions and changes
     * Added dvi, ps and tex output format options to a2x(1).
     * Added --dblatex option to a2x(1) so dblatex(1) can be used to
       generate PDFs.
     * Added custom dblatex(1) configuration files (in distribution
       ./dblatex directory) that are used by a2x(1).
     * dblatex(1) is now used to generate the distributed PDF version of
       the AsciiDoc User Guide.
     * If you don’t need a customized the link caption you can enter the
       http, https, ftp, file URLs and email addresses without any special
       macro syntax — you get the links by just cutting and pasting URLs
       and emails addresses. This also makes it easier to open links
       directly form AsciiDoc source ( most editors allow you to open URLs
       directly). The Vim syntax highlighter has been updated to reflect
       these changes.
     * Highlighted source code paragraphs have been implemented — it’s a
       much more convenient way to enter short code examples (see [141]the
       online docs).
     * The source highlighter and music filter syntax has changed — they
       now used the ListingBlock syntax customized with source and music
       style attribute values. This follows the Paragraph styling
       convention introduced by the source paragraph (previous item) and
       is easier to read. The old syntax still works but has been
       deprecated.
     * QuoteBlocks now have a verse style — you no longer have to nest a
       verse LiteralBlock inside a QuoteBlock for verses. The verse style
       on the LiteralBlock has been deprecated (still works though) and
       the style attribute is positional attribute 1, pushing attribution
       and citetitle attributes to the right (you’ll need to insert a
       quote attribute into your existing QuoteBlocks).
     * It is no up to the DocBook processor to highlight source code
       syntax in <programlisting> elements rather than GNU Highlighter —
       this is the correct way to handle it, plus dblatex(1) makes a much
       better job.
     * scaledwidth and align attributes have been added to the image
       macro. They apply to DocBook outputs (specifically for PDF
       documents). scaledwidth sets the image size as a percent of the
       available page width; align applies left, center or right
       horizontal image justification.
     * Added a2x(1) --fop-opts=FOP_OPTS option (patch submitted by Miklos
       Vajna).
     * Added a2x(1) --dblatex-opts=DBLATEX_OPTS option.
     * Added Mikhail Yakshin’s FOP 0.95 patch which fixes a long-standing
       fo.xsl problem and allows PDF’s to be generated with FOP 0.95
       (previously had to use FOP 0.20.5).
     * The User Guide has been updated and outdated FOP configuration and
       installation sections removed.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed stylesheets/xhtml11-manpage.css not being included when
       linkcss attribute was used.
     * Configuration file *-style attributes are now dumped correctly.
     * Fixed FAILED: malformed section entry LaTeX backend error.

   See the also the [142]AsciiDoc repository changelog.
     __________________________________________________________________

25. Version 8.2.6 (2008-04-29)

   Additions and changes
     * Enhancements to the Vim AsciiDoc syntax highlighter, for example,
       quoted text is now highlighted in titles and macro captions.
     * If you define the data-uri intrinsic attribute images referenced by
       image macros will be embedded in XHTML using the [143]data: URI
       scheme. NOTE: Microsoft browser support for the data: URI scheme is
       currently limited to MSIE 8 beta 1.
     * Added toc-title attribute to allow custom table of contents titles.
     * Added references to Alex Efros’s AsciiDoc Cheatsheet to AsciiDoc
       website.
     * asciidoc(1) and a2x(1) man pages formatted to conform to
       man-pages(7) recommendations.
     * Old code-filter syntax (pre-8.1.0) is no longer recognized so that
       malformed two-line level 2 titles are no longer confused with
       code-filter block delimiters.
     * Added → ← ⇒ ⇐ arrow replacements from the Arrows block of Unicode.
     * Added DocBook refentry lang attribute — patch contributed by
       VMiklos.
     * AttributeEntry names can now be numeric (“named macro targets”).
     * Hide Table of Contents title if Table of Contents empty — patch
       contributed by Alex Efros.
     * Various XHTML CSS tweaks.
     * Code cleanup:
          + Replaced realpath() with Python 2.2 os.path.realpath() library
            function.
          + Replaced old string library functions with string methods.
          + Use file generators instead of readlines().
          + Renamed entities that shadowed builtins.
          + Standardized string quoting.
          + Dropped readlines() function.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed broken CSS for decimal ordered lists nested in alpha ordered
       list, thanks to Alex Efros.
     * A missing closing block delimiter now reports the opening delimiter
       line number instead of the end of file line number.
     * Fixed an error generated by the asciidoc -e option when there are
       no block definitions — patch contributed by Alejandro Mery.
     * Handle both \r\n (as well as \n) line separators that may be
       returned by {sys} attribute evaluation.
     * Numbered attribute names no longer interfere with positional
       attribute list values.
     __________________________________________________________________

26. Version 8.2.5 (2007-11-18)

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed exception thrown by illegal command-line arguments.
     * Rolled back the with warning bug fix introduced in 8.2.4 — it was
       incompatible with Python <2.5.
     __________________________________________________________________

27. Version 8.2.4 (2007-11-10)

   Additions and changes
     * You can now use the lang attribute to set the DocBook language
       attribute.
     * Attribute values can now contain attribute references.
     * If the lang attribute is defined then configuration files named
       like lang-<lang>.conf will be loaded automatically.
     * The help file name help-<lang>.conf is based on the AsciiDoc lang
       attribute, defaults to help.conf (English).
     * Admonition, figure and table captions have been factored into a
       predefined set of caption_* attributes. They only apply to directly
       generated (X)HTML outputs (DocBook stylesheets generate their own
       language specific captions based on the lang attribute).
     * Dropped platform dependent doc/asciidoc.chm file from distribution
       documentation formats.

   Bug fixes
     * The spurious warning with will become a reserved keyword in Python
       2.6 has been suppressed.
     __________________________________________________________________

28. Version 8.2.3 (2007-09-12)

   Additions and changes
     * Added VMiklos’s permalink patch for auto-generated section IDs
       (enabled by default by the sectids attribute).
     * Added [144]FAQ to website.
     * Changed format of {localdate} attribute to ISO 8601 (%Y-%m-%d).
     * Added abc2ly --beams=None option to make music2png.py conform to
       ABC’s notion of beams.
     * XHTML level 2 section headings are now styled with an underlining
       border.
     * XHTML links to AsciiDoc title elements are now implemented with
       title ID attributes (previously separate <a> element targets were
       generated.
     * Multi-word first, middle and last names can be entered in the
       header author line using the underscore as a word separator.
     * The nested inline macros restriction has now been lifted, for
       example you can now include links and inline images inside
       footnotes.
     * Help topic names can be shortened (so long as they are not
       ambiguous). For example asciidoc -hm will print the AsciiDoc man
       page.
     * Added {two_colons} and {two_semicolons} attributes for escaping
       labeled list ambiguity.
     * If quirks mode is disabled the XHTML Mime Type is set to the
       recommended application/xhtml+xml (rather than text/html).

   Bug fixes
     * Author information is now correctly set when using attribute
       entries in the header instead of an author line (previously the
       author attribute was not being calculated correctly and there were
       attribute substitution problems).
     __________________________________________________________________

29. Version 8.2.2 (2007-07-22)

   Additions and changes
     * [145]LaTeXMathML capability has been added for users who are more
       familiar with or prefer LaTeX math formulas to the [146]ASCIIMathML
       notation (thanks to Arthur Sakellariou for the patch).
     * The source highlight and code filters now process embedded
       callouts.
     * Added an --attribute=ATTRIBUTE option to a2x(1) for passing
       attribute values to asciidoc(1) (a shortcut for --asciidoc-opts="-a
       ATTRIBUTE").
     * Image block and inline macros prepend optional {imagesdir}
       attribute to image link targets.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed an assertion error that occurred when a configuration file
       containing an include::[] macro was loaded using the --conf-file
       option and the configuration file name did not include an explicit
       directory path — patch submitted by Dmitry Potapov.
     * Asciidoc titles are only converted to lower case if all characters
       are upper case otherwise case is left unchanged — patch submitted
       by Dmitry Potapov.
     * Added a missing check that input is not stdin before loading
       configuration files from the document directory — patch submitted
       by Dmitry Potapov.
     * Attribute list items must evaluate to strings, numbers or None
       (previously it was possible to evaluate to other object types which
       resulted in surprising attribute values).
     * If an AsciiDoc document has no title an empty XHTML 1.1 title
       element is created — previously the title element was dropped which
       resulted in invalid XHTML 1.1.
     * The Vim syntax file no longer highlights escaped callouts.
     * The Vim syntax highlighter now correctly highlights Double-dollar
       passthroughs when they enclose dollar delimited ASCIIMathML and
       LaTeXMathML formulas.
     __________________________________________________________________

30. Version 8.2.1 (2007-04-06)

   Additions and changes
     * A number of improvements have been made to the Vim syntax
       highlighter, for example the word C++ is no longer mistaken for the
       start of an unconstrained monospace quote.
     * Labeled list definitions have been tightened — a list label can no
       longer containing trailing spaces. The following example is no
       longer recognized as a valid list label:

        Lorum ipsum
                This change implements the originally intended behavior
                (as per the AsciiDoc documentation and examples) so there
                should be very few compatibility issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

31. Version 8.2.0 (2007-04-04)

   Additions and changes
     * A Vim syntax file is now included in the AsciiDoc distribution
       (inspired by Felix Obenhuber’s asciidoc.vim script). You can find
       it (along with a Vim filetype detection script in the distribution
       ./vim/ directory (the scripts are installed automatically by the
       AsciiDoc installer ./install.sh). See Appendix J of the AsciiDoc
       User Guide for details.
     * Added toclevel attribute (1..4) which sets the number of title
       levels reported in the table of contents. Defaults to 2 and must be
       used with the toc attribute. Example usage:
  $ asciidoc -a toc -a toclevels=3 doc/asciidoc.txt
     * Added a listindex attribute which is the current list item index
       (1..). If this attribute appears outside a list its value is the
       number of items in the most recently closed list.
     * The single line titles syntax now accepts trailing suffixes — this
       syntax matches the title line syntax of a number of popular Wiki
       markups.
     * If a QuoteBlock has no attribution or citetitle then the DocBook
       <attribution> element is not generated (previously generated empty
       <attribution> element).
     * If the text of a labeled list item is blank then no texttag is
       written.
     * An end of line backslash performs line continuation for horizontal
       labeled list items.
     * The Revision line now accommodates Subversion $Id markers (in
       addition to CVS and RCS markers). Thanks to Tiago Sturmer Daitx for
       this patch.
     * Implemented a2x(1) option --skip-asciidoc which allows a2x(1) to
       convert DocBook XML files not derived from AsciiDoc sources.
     * If a2x(1) --doctype option is not specified it defaults to manpage
       if --format=manpage else defaults to article (previously --doctype
       always defaulted to article).
     * Added an External Resources section to the [147]AsciiDoc home page.
     __________________________________________________________________

32. Version 8.1.0 (2006-10-22)

   Additions and changes
     * AsciiDoc generated XHTML documents now display a table of contents
       if the toc attribute is defined (JavaScript needs to be enabled for
       this to work). Thanks to Troy Hanson who contributed this feature
       based on a JavaScript by Mihai Bazon. I’ve simplified things
       somewhat to match Docbook XSL Stylesheets style, see Troy’s
       [148]tpl User Guide for a fancier layout. Use the -a toc -a
       numbered command-line options to produce a number table of
       contents.
     * A [149]music filter is included in the distribution ./filters/
       directory. It translates music in [150]LilyPond or [151]ABC
       notation to standard classical notation in the form of a trimmed
       PNG image which is inserted into the AsciiDoc output document.
     * Incorporated Paul Melis’s Win32 filter patch. This workaround
       allows AsciiDoc to run filters under Windows.
     * Added uninstall.sh script.
     * Rather than proliferate a confusing number of filter block
       delimiters the following convention has been adopted: delimiters
       belonging to DelimitedBlock filters distributed with AsciiDoc will
       consist of a word (normally a noun identifying the block content)
       followed by four or more tilde characters. This has necessitated
       changing existing filter delimiters (the old delimiters still work
       but may be deprecated in future versions):
          + The example code filter block delimiter is now the word code
            followed by four or more tilde characters.
          + The source highlight filter block delimiter is now the word
            source followed by four or more tilde characters.
     * Conditionally redefined subscript and superscripting so they use
       the old replacements mechanism when asciidoc7compatible is defined
       rather than the asciidoc 8 default unconstrained quoting (patch for
       affected files attached).
     * Moved the source highlight filter from ./examples/ to ./filter/.
     * Added {verbose} intrinsic attribute (useful for passing verbose
       flag to filters).
     * Added {outdir} intrinsic attribute.
     * Renamed {docdir} intrinsic attribute to unambiguous {indir}
       ({docdir} still works but may be removed in future release).
     * If asciidoc(1) outputs to stdout then intrinsic attribute {docname}
       is extracted from the input file name.
     __________________________________________________________________

33. Version 8.0.0 (2006-08-27)

   This is a major release because changes to quoting and index entry
   handling may break existing documents (see Additions and changes below
   and Appendix A: Migration Notes in the AsciiDoc User Guide).

   Please report any problems you encounter.

   [152]Stuart Rackham

   Additions and changes
     * Quoting can can occur within words (based on patch submitted by
       Benjamin Klum). See the Unconstrained Quotes sub-section in the
       User Guide.
     * The underline and plus characters can be used as alternatives to
       the existing apostrophe and backtick quote characters. They are
       arguably better choices than the apostrophe and backtick as they
       are not confused with punctuation.
     * The syntax for index entry macros have have been deprecated from
       +...+ and ++...++ to ((...)) and (((...))) respectively. Rationale:
          + Bracketing is consistent other with [[...]] and <<...>>
            reference macros.
          + To easily confused with triple plus passthroughs.
          + To make way for the new monospace quoting.
     * Superscripts and subscripts are implemented as constrained quotes
       so they can now be escaped with a leading backslash and prefixed
       with with an attribute list.
     * An experimental LaTeX backend has been written by Benjamin Klum (a
       number additions in this release are to accommodate the LaTeX
       backend).
     * include macro file names now expand environment variables and tilde
       expansions.
     * A configuration file [quotes] entry can be undefined by setting to
       a blank value.
     * Added callto inline macro for Skype callto links.
     * Added colnumber attribute for table data markup.
     * A leading comment block or comment lines are now skipped
       (previously a document had to start with either attribute entries
       or a document Title).
     * Experimental rows attribute (number of source lines in table)
       available in table markup templates (used by experimental LaTeX
       backend).
     * Included install shell script written by [153]Jacob Mandelson for
       installing the tarball distribution.
     * Added INSTALL documentation file.
     * Added replacements2 substitution options — a second replacements
       section.
     * Added the ability to redefine normal and verbatim substitutions
       with subsnormal and subsverbatim entries in configuration file
       [miscellaneous] section.
     * By default AttributeEntry values are substituted for
       specialcharacters and attributes, if you want a different
       AttributeEntry substitution set the attributeentry-subs attribute.
     * The name in name=value configuration file entries can now end with
       a backslash, just escape the trailing backslash with a backslash.
       For example:
  abc\\=xyz
       Results in name=abc\ and value=xyz —  previously this would have
       escaped the = character.
     * A blank configuration file section deletes any preceding section
       with the same name (applies to non-markup template sections).
     * A command-line attribute value with a @ suffix does not override
       existing document and configuration file attributes (normally
       command-line attributes have precedence over document and
       configuration file attributes).
     * localtime attribute is now encoded from the native system encoding
       to the output encoding. Patch submitted by [154]FKtPp — here’s his
       description of the problem:
       “I am a Chinese user of AsciiDoc and I find that when I use UTF-8
       (the default encoding) to write asciidoc documents in Windows
       platform the resulting html footer line will get screwed. It was
       caused by a localized tzname that was always encoded in the windows
       native encoding, which in my case is cp936.”
     * a2x(1) can generate Open Document Text files using
       [155]docbook2odf. Currently docbook2odf(1) only processes a subset
       of DocBook, unimplemented elements are skipped.
     * The a2x(1) format option defaults to xhtml (previously a format had
       to be specified explicitly).
     * The -d, \--doctype=DOCTYPE option has been added to a2x(1) which is
       a shortcut for --asciidoc-options="--doctype=DOCTYPE".
     * Replaced a2x(1) --no-icons and --no-copy options with their negated
       equivalents: --icons and --copy respectively. The default behavior
       has also changed: copying and use of icons is disabled by default.
       Rationale:
          + To make the default behavior more consistent since use of
            icons and CSS stylesheets does not apply to all formats.
          + To make the default behavior less surprising (the creation of
            icon and stylesheet output files must now be explicit).
     * a2x(1) has been bumped from version 0.1.1 to version 1.0.0.

   Bug fixes
     * Removed duplicate ./doc/a2x.1.txt from distribution tarball.
     * Documentation errata.
     * Attribute replacement is no longer performed twice in Titles and
       AttributeEntrys.
     * a2x(1) skipped asciidoc(1) execution when rerun with different
       --asciidoc-options options, it now always executes asciidoc(1). The
       problem was that previously asciidoc(1) was executed only if the
       output file was missing or older than the source file.
     __________________________________________________________________

34. Version 7.1.2 (2006-03-07)

   Additions and changes
     * Support for [156]ASCIIMathML has been added. See Appendix I:
       ASCIIMathML Support in the User Guide and the examples at
       [157]http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/asciimath.html.
     * You can now prefix quoted text with inline attributes lists. You
       can use this to set font size and color (XHTML and HTML outputs).
     * Added ##...## quoting — it does nothing — it’s purpose is to allow
       inline attributes to be applied to normal text.
     * An inline passthrough mechanism has been implemented.
     * Configuration file comment lines can be escaped with a backslash —
       this is to allows the inclusion of configuration lines that start
       with a hash character.
     * The scriptsdir attribute can be used to specify the name of the
       directory containing linked JavaScripts (see the [158]User Guide
       for details.
     * The BackendBlock has been renamed PassthroughBlock for consistency
       with the new inline passthrough naming.
     * a2x(1) now works with the older bash(1) version 2.05b. Patch
       submitted by [159]Francis Daly.
     * Content included by the include1::[] system macro is no longer
       subject to attribute substitution so that ambiguities no longer
       arise when used to include CSS or JavaScript files.
     __________________________________________________________________

35. Version 7.1.1 (2006-02-24)

   Additions and changes
     * The caption attribute can be used to customize admonition captions
       as well as image, table and example block element title prefixes
       (xhtml11 and html4 backends).
     * You can now override the default icon image using the icon
       attribute to specify the path of the linked image (xhtml11 and
       html4 backends only).
     * The deprecated imagesdir attribute is no longer recognized (use
       iconsdir instead).
     * Added Appendix H: Using AsciiDoc with non-English Languages to the
       AsciiDoc User Guide.
     * Added Admonition Icons and Captions subsection to the User Guide
       explaining how to customize Admonition elements.

   Bug fixes
     * a2x(1) failed when configuration files were installed in the global
       /etc/asciidoc/ directory — it was only searching the directory
       containing the asciidoc executable (thanks to Christian Wiese for
       finding and submitting a patch this bug).
     * The html4 backend admonition caption now correctly displays the
       admonition caption attribute (previously displayed the style
       attribute).
     __________________________________________________________________

36. Version 7.1.0 (2006-01-13)

   Additions and changes
     * a2x(1) toolchain wrapper utility. This overcomes the biggest hurdle
       for new users which seems to be assembling and using a working
       DocBook XML toolchain. With a2x(1) you can generate XHTML (chunked
       and unchunked), PDF, man page, HTML Help and text file outputs from
       an AsciiDoc input file with a single command. All you need to
       install (in addition to AsciiDoc) is xsltproc(1), DocBook XSL
       Stylesheets and optionally FOP (if you want PDF) or lynx(1) (if you
       want text).
     * Block titles can now start with any non-space character (previously
       where not allowed to start with .~-_ characters).
     * ./stylesheets/docbook.css renamed to ./stylesheets/docbook-xsl.css
       to clarify its function.
     * Renamed ./docbook-xsl/manpages.xsl to ./docbook-xsl/manpage.xsl for
       consistency.
     * Admonition and navigation icons moved to ./images/icons/ to clarify
       usage and conform with a2x(1) usage.
     * Renamed xhtml11 intrinsic attribute imagesdir to iconsdir to keep
       vocab consistent and changed default value to ./images/icons
       (previously ./images). imagesdir attribute still accepted but
       deprecated.
     * Unused image files have been weeded out of the distribution.
     * Packager notes (appendix B) have been updated to reflect the needs
       of a2x(1).

 Important
          The renaming of the xhtml11 backend imagesdir intrinsic attribute and
          it’s new default value introduces a backward compatibility issue: if
          you use the icons attribute you will need to either move your icons to
          the new default ./images/icons location or include an
          --attribute{nbsp}iconsdir="your_icons_path" option in your asciidoc
          commands.

   Bug fixes
     * Backslash line continuation is now observed in verbatim paragraphs.
     * Fixed errors generated by example
       ./examples/website/build-website.sh script.
     __________________________________________________________________

37. Version 7.0.4 (2005-12-08)

   Additions and changes
     * Added ternary conditional attributes
       {<name>@<regexp>:<value1>[:<value2>]} and
       {<name>$<regexp>:<value1>[:<value2>]}.
     * Safety violations now generate errors (they previously generated
       warnings).
     * asciidoc(1) now defaults to safe mode, consequently the
       [miscellaneous] safe mode entry and --safe command-line option are
       no longer necessary (though for backward compatibility asciidoc(1)
       still accepts the --safe option).
     * Backend Blocks are now flagged unsafe (they could be used to
       include arbitrary and hence potentially unsafe output content).
     * Filters are no longer considered unsafe. There’s not much point in
       insisting on filter safety since the installation of an unsafe
       filter would require the introduction of new or modified
       configuration files — if your application configurations can be
       compromised you’re in all sorts of trouble (safe mode protects
       against unsafe input files not unsafe configuration). As with all
       filters, before installing, you should verify that they can’t be
       coerced into generating malicious output or exposing sensitive
       information.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed a lot of glaring grammatical and factual errors in the User
       Guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

38. Version 7.0.3 (2005-12-01)

   Additions and changes
     * Added --safe and --unsafe command-line options — AsciiDoc can now
       be executed in a safe mode which disallows the execution of
       arbitrary code or the inclusion of arbitrary files (see
       [160]Appendix C in the AsciiDoc User Guide).
     * Included [161]source-highlight filter in the distribution
       ./examples/source-highlight-filter/ directory (based on filter
       submitted by [162]Ryan Phillips).
     * Included the DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.69.1 customizations used to
       generate the distributed AsciiDoc documentation (read the
       asciidoc-docbook-xsl.txt file in the distribution ./docbook-xsl/
       directory).
     * AsciiDoc DocBook XSL Stylesheet drivers moved from ./doc/ to
       ./docbook-xsl/.
     * Modified ./doc/manpages.xsl so only URL content is displayed in
       manpages.

   Bug fixes
     * Explicitly set table CSS border style (xhtml11 backend) to solid
       because default border styles vary from browser to browser.
     __________________________________________________________________

39. Version 7.0.2 (2005-08-28)

   Additions and changes
     * There are now long versions of all AsciiDoc options.
     * If the --backend is not specified it defaults to xhtml11.
     * Added CSS simulated frames layout to the examples website (see
       ./examples/website/layout2/README-website.txt). This layout does
       not work with IE6 and the original tables based layout is still the
       default.
     * Support page added to AsciiDoc website.

   Bug fixes
     * Invalid options are now trapped gracefully.
     * Documentation errata.
     __________________________________________________________________

40. Version 7.0.1 (2005-06-24)

   Additions and changes
     * Reverted to use of strong, em, tt XHTML tags — they’re more obvious
       and no less correct than span tags, besides, the generated file
       sizes are smaller (the User Guide was 11% smaller).
     * Table title rendered with caption tag rather than a separate div.
     * The AsciiDoc stylesdir attribute (if specified) is now recognized
       when searching for embedded stylesheets (previously only searched
       default ./stylesheets directory).
     * Default charset encoding changed from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 — it’s
       less language specific and displays most common languages.
     * template::[] macros now expand in all configuration file sections
       previously only in markup template sections.
     * Cleaned up example website layout CSS and configuration
       (presentation has not been changed).
     * Refactored xhtml11.conf configuration file.
     * Set consistent and sensible permissions on distributed files.
     * White space is now stripped from DSV formatted table cell data.
     * class="tableblock" attribute added to tables generated by
       xhtml-deprecated-css.conf to assist CSS.

   Bug fixes
     * Illegal character set encoder (specified by the AsciiDoc encoding
       attribute) and character data are trapped gracefully.
     * AsciiDoc table format attribute in table attribute lists were not
       recognized.
     * The nested horizontal labeled list example in the AsciiDoc User
       Guide has been dropped — it generated invalid DocBook markup.
     __________________________________________________________________

41. Version 7.0.0 (2005-06-06)

   This is a major release with many code and documentation changes.
   Please report any problems you encounter.

   [163]Stuart Rackham

   Additions and changes
     * A new xhtml11 backend generates XHTML 1.1 with integrated CSS2
       replacing the previous xhtml, css, and css-embedded backends.
     * The CSS stylesheets have finally been rewritten.
     * The asciidoc(1) command help now includes user [164]customizable
       help topics. When asciidoc is invoked with the --help option the
       command argument is interpreted as a help topic.
     * The previous example website has been replaced by the actual
       AsciiDoc website (see ./examples/website/.
     * XHTML generation options now controlled by the following
       attributes: badges, linkcss, icons, numbered, quirks, theme,
       stylesdir, imagesdir (see the [165]User Guide for details.
     * By default HTML and XHTML are output as stand-alone documents (no
       embedded CSS and no linked admonition icon images).
     * Documents encoded with the UTF-8 Unicode character set are now
       processed thanks to a patch supplied by [166]Viktor Vasilev.
     * The -a ^name command-line syntax to undefine an attribute has been
       deprecated in favor of the -a name! syntax.
     * AttributeEntry syntax addition: :name!: to undefine name attribute.
     * Added template system block macro to allow the inclusion of one
       configuration file template section within another.
     * A verse style attribute can now be applied to literal paragraphs
       and blocks to reproduce line breaks and white space from the source
       document.
     * Replacements and Special Words can now be escaped with leading
       backslashes.
     * Replacements are now processed in configuration file order
       (previous ordering was indeterminate).
     * System macros can now be used in the base asciidoc.conf
       configuration file.
     * Deprecated features that emitted warnings in prior versions are no
       longer tolerated.
     * The eval system attribute expression evaluates to False the
       attribute is undefined, if it evaluates to True the result is an
       empty string.
     * The Paragraph and DelimitedBlock presubs parameter can be aliased
       as subs.
     * Added verbatim substitutions option.
     * Renamed List Continuation Block to List Block and renamed the
       listcontinuation option to list.
     * Deprecated default substitutions option (use normal instead).
     * The section-numbers section numbering attribute has be renamed
       numbered.
     * Dropped the #UNDER CONSTRUCTION# block macro.
     * Rewrote Paragraph and DelimitedBlock handlers adding a [167]styles
       configuration entry.

   Bug fixes
     * Included files are no longer read inside conditionally excluded
       content.
     * Manpage command names containing dashes (in the manpage NAME
       section) were misinterpreted as the spaced dash command
       name/purpose separator. Bug report and patch supplied by [168]David
       Greaves.
     * Unexpected error following malformed author line error.
     __________________________________________________________________

42. Version 6.0.3 (2005-04-20)

   Additions and changes
     * Special characters are now substituted in AttributeEntry element
       values.
     * Spaced and unspaced em dashes are now recognized (previously only
       spaced em dashes were recognized).
     * Replaced the table noborders option with richer frame and grid
       attributes.
     * The duplicate macro warning message now only occurs when the
       verbose (-v) option is enabled.
     * Single lines starting with two forward slashes hard up against the
       left margin are treated as comments and are not processed.
     * Renamed section delimited block option to sectionbody to more
       accurately reflect it’s role.
     * Added a List Continuation block — a specialized delimited block
       that is functionally equivalent to the List Item Continuation
       feature except that the list contained within the block does not
       require explicit + list item continuation lines.
     * Dropped deprecated <u> tags from generated HTML.
     * Literal Block delimiters must now consist of at least four points
       (previously three) to avoid lone ellipsis ambiguity.

   Bug fixes
     * Some system attribute evaluation failures caused unexpected
       exceptions to occur.
     __________________________________________________________________

43. Version 6.0.2 (2005-03-30)

   Additions and changes
     * Three new system block macros have been added — eval, sys and sys2
       which are the block macro equivalents to the same named system
       attributes.
     * Intrinsic macros have been renamed system macros along with action
       attributes which have been renamed system attributes:
          + To reflect their common (though contextually different)
            behavior.
          + To avoid confusion with intrinsic attributes.

   Bug fixes
     * Asciidoc now searches in /etc/asciidoc/filters for filters.
     __________________________________________________________________

44. Version 6.0.1 (2005-03-06)

   Additions and changes
     * A global configuration file location /etc/asciidoc has been added
       and is now processed before all other locations (patch supplied by
       [169]Fredrik Steen).
     * Recoded tempfile.mktemp() and other artifacts that are no longer
       necessary or desirable (patches supplied by [170]Fredrik Steen).
     * Added BUGS file to the distribution.

   Bug fixes
     * Illegal comment syntax in css-embedded-stylesheet.conf resulted in
       illegal CSS in files generated by the css-embedded backend.
     __________________________________________________________________

45. Version 6.0.0 (2005-01-28)

   This release has had some fairly major code and documentation changes.
   Please report any problems you encounter.

   [171]Stuart Rackham

   A lot of new stuff. A new major version number — some regression
   incompatibility (hopefully mitigated by deprecated warnings).

   Went mad trying to rein in the current feature anarchy — established a
   unified notion of document attributes. Attempted to introduce a
   consistent vocabulary — renamed many poorly or inconsistently named
   entities.

   Actually, deprecated syntax is still processed correctly in almost all
   cases. One source of incompatibility that may arise if you have
   customized CSS stylesheets is the change of AsciiDoc CSS class names
   (see below). I guess the moral is if you’ve done a lot of configuration
   file customization and are happy with version 5 then you may want to
   stay put.

   Note
       This version requires Python 2.3 or better to run.

   Additions and changes
     * Glossary entries have been renamed attributes. This eliminates
       confusion with the accepted meaning of glossary.
     * An AttributeEntry block element has been added so that document
       attributes can be assigned from within an AsciiDoc document.
     * The AttributeList block element has been added which is a more
       general solution than the (now deprecated) DelimitedBlock
       arguments.
     * An BlockId element has been added for setting block element anchor
       (link target) IDs.
     * Quoted text can now span multiple lines (thanks to James Bowlin for
       this patch).
     * Inline macros can now span multiple lines.
     * ‘`double backtick / apostrophe’' quotes generate “curly quotes”.
     * A warning is now emitted for out of order list item (applies to
       explicitly enumerated numbered list items).
     * Added include action attribute.
     * A line of three or more apostrophes generates an HTML horizontal
       ruler (<hr/> tag). You will get a warning if processed with
       non-HTML backend.
     * An {imagesdir} attribute specifies image file location for images
       referenced in configuration files when generating HTML (the default
       location is images).
     * An {stylesdir} attribute specifies the location of CSS stylesheets
       when generating styled HTML (the default location for configured
       markup is .).
     * The use of the (often inappropriately named) {caption} attribute
       list entry has been deprecated, use {0} instead.
     * New ExampleBlock delimited block along with associated variants
       Note, Tip, Warning, Caution and Important.
     * The docbook.conf file now facilitates the optional inclusion of a
       DocBook revision history file.
     * To better reflect their purpose the following block elements have
       been renamed: VerbatimBlock to ListingBlock; IndentedBlock to
       LiteralBlock; IndentedParagraph to LiteralParagraph; CustomBlock to
       BackendBlock; SimpleSection to SectionBody. Any corresponding CSS
       class names have also been changed which could result in backward
       incompatibility in customized stylesheets.
     * Swapped plain DocBook admonition icons for Jimmac’s DocBook icons
       ([172]http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3). The original plain
       icons have been moved to ./images/plain.
     * Renamed html backend to xhtml to better reflect it’s function
       (former html-4 backend renamed to html).
     * A new inline anchor macro syntax [[[<id>]]] is available, it
       displays [<id>] at the anchor location and is for anchoring
       bibliography list entries.
     * An optional single-line titles syntax can be used.
     * Tweaks to distributed CSS stylesheets and FOP fo.xsl customization
       file.
     * List Item Continuation has been implemented which allows additional
       block elements to be included in list items by separating them from
       the preceding list item element with a line containing a single
       plus character.
     * A new Horizontal Labeled List list type has been added. Generates
       two column list — the first column contains the list element
       labels, the second contains the element text. Same syntax as
       Vertical Labeled Lists except the double colon label suffix is
       followed by the start of the list item text.

   Bug fixes
     * Fixed broken backslash line continuation.
     * Labeled list end tags were not undergoing attribute substitution.
     * Documents without any author information now generate legitimate
       DocBook (previously if the author line was not included in the
       document header then an empty (illegal) DocBook author element was
       generated).
     * Multiple spaces in filter command arguments were replaced by a
       single space. The ./examples/asciidoc2text/asciidoc2text.sh script
       now indents text correctly.
     __________________________________________________________________

46. Version 5.1.1 (2004-10-10)

   15-December-2004: Interim update: Updated asciidoc.py to fix broken
   join_lines function — no other changes.
     * PDF documentation is now produced from DocBook XML using XSLTLib
       and FOP. Previously we processed DocBook SGML with jw(1) (which
       used Dvips to convert DVI files to PDF). FOP has come a long way in
       the last 12 months and produces very acceptable PDF under both
       Linux and Windows.
     * Sections detailing how to install and use the DocBook XSL
       Stylesheets, xsltproc, FOP toolchain and the AsciiDoc XSLT drivers
       have been added to the User Guide.
     * The PDF output from the he example article template has been
       included in the distribution (./doc/article.pdf).
     * Special characters are emitted using decimal Unicode character
       codes (previously used named character entities which cannot be
       assumed included in non-HTML documents).
     * Added registered trademark ® to [replacements].
     * CSS stylesheet tweaks.
     * Admonitions (Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution) include icons
       when generating css output.
     __________________________________________________________________

47. Version 5.1.0 (2004-09-18)

     * Callouts have been implemented (see the Callouts section of the
       AsciiDoc User Guide for details).
     * Added XSL drivers for generating XHTML, chunked XHTML and HTML Help
       from DocBook XML using XSL stylesheets and xsltproc(1).
     * Added CSS stylesheet for HTML generated from DocBook XML using XSL
       stylesheets.
     * Distribution contains HTML Help formatted User Guide
       (./doc/asciidoc.chm), the User Guide tells you how it’s generated.
     * Images referred to by distributed stylesheets are now located in
       the ./images subdirectory (previously located in .).
     * Filters path names are now handled properly under Cygwin.
     * The usual documentation and examples additions, updates and
       polishing.
     __________________________________________________________________

48. Version 5.0.9 (2004-09-09)

     * The convention of using a .asc file extension for AsciiDoc files
       has been dropped in favor of the familiar .txt extension. It makes
       more sense in that AsciiDoc is a text presentation format and
       because .asc clashed with the same extension used by other
       applications. It’s only a naming convention — you don’t have to
       switch if you don’t want to.
     * Changed the subscript formatting character from underline to tilde
       since underscores in file names are reasonably common (especially
       in link and image macros).
     * An alternative syntax for the index term inline macro has been
       added: ++<primary>,<secondary>,<tertiary>++.
     * Index terms that have secondary and tertiary entries now
       additionally generate separate index terms for the secondary and
       tertiary entries.
     * A +<primary>+ index term inline macro has been added which displays
       the term in the primary text flow.
     * Added alternative variable list definition using double semi-colon
       terminator as opposed to the standard double colon terminator so
       variable lists can be nested to two levels.
     * Footnotes now appear on a separate line in HTML and Linuxdoc
       outputs.
     * Python version compatibility is checked at startup.
     * Preface and appendix section titles in multi-part Book documents
       are meant to be out of sequence — warnings are no longer emitted
       when outputting HTML.
     * Empty section warnings have been replaced by error messages and are
       emitted only if invalid markup would result.
     * Missing macro sections or invalid macro name warnings are only
       generated at startup if the -v (verbose) option is set. Otherwise
       they are deferred until a matching macro is encountered in the
       input file.
     * Missing or invalid table definition warnings are only generated at
       startup if the -v (verbose) option is set. Otherwise they are
       deferred until a matching table is encountered in the input file.
     * AsciiDoc now makes more of an effort to continue in the face of
       errors.
     * Fixed broken ./examples/website/main.aap script.
     * Converted distribution text files DOS text format as a sop to
       Windows users with challenged text editors.
     * Documentation additions and corrections.
     __________________________________________________________________

49. Version 5.0.8 (2004-05-15)

     * Spurious out of sequence level 2 warnings no longer appear when
       processing book document multi-part book top level Preface and
       Appendix sub-sections since they are (correctly) out of sequence.
     * A warning is no longer emitted for empty Index sections since this
       is normal when generating DocBook outputs.
     * Fixed: [quotes] configuration file entries where not being
       overridden by downstream configuration file entries.
     * Footnote text is now output enclosed in square brackets in HTML
       documents.
     * Added superscripts and subscripts to the standard PRS configuration
       files.
     * Adjusted CSS stylesheets so list titles don’t have so much space
       between title and first list item (broken in IE6 due to poor CSS
       compliance). Lessened sidebar title top margin.
     __________________________________________________________________

50. Version 5.0.7 (2004-04-22)

     * The version 5.0.6 README incorrectly stated that AsciiDoc would run
       under Python 2.0, in fact it requires Python 2.1 or better. The
       README has been corrected.
     * Documented techniques for combining and splitting AsciiDoc
       documents and processing the combined and split parts (see the Tips
       and Tricks section of the User Guide).
     * An example of marking up superscripts and subscripts is documented
       in the Tips and Tricks section of the User Guide (the example
       configuration file is in the AsciiDoc examples directory).
     * Added ellipsis to shipped [replacements]; three periods output an
       ellipsis entity.
     * Removed unused SectionClose class.
     * The AsciiDoc Preamble element is output as a DocBook Preface when
       processed as a book document type (in older AsciiDoc versions a
       warning was issued and processing stopped).
     * Fixed a quoting anomaly: quoted text can no longer begin or end
       with with white space.
     __________________________________________________________________

51. Version 5.0.6 (2004-03-07)

     * New image macro implements optional image scaling and linking and
       works in both inline and block contexts. The image macro obsolesces
       the existing graphic block macro and icon inline macro.
     * Macro substitution section names now have -inlinemacro and
       -blockmacro suffixes to resolve context ambiguity, make their
       purpose clearer and relieve section namespace congestion.
     * Header derived glossary entries can now be overridden from the
       command-line.
     * Special character substitution is now performed on AuthorLine
       derived author names.
     * A macro or block argument called options can be used as a shortcut
       for a list named arguments with zero length string values.
     * Tables can be output without borders using the options="noborders"
       argument.
     * Table data lines that do not immediately follow a table section
       underline can now be blank. This allows CSV data with embedded
       blank lines to be processed correctly.
     * Blank DSV format table data lines are silently skipped.
     * Tightened up on enforcement of configuration file section names to
       reduce the possibility of section content being seen as a section
       header line.
     * Section titles can be optionally suffixed with title arguments
       enclosed in double square brackets.
     * A replacement has been added to asciidoc.conf to replace inline
       double dashes with the &mdash; entity.
     * Changed the .UNDER-CONSTRUCTION. macro syntax to
       #UNDER-CONSTRUCTION# so it is not mistaken for a BlockTitle.
       Similarly changed the .NEW. replacement with &#35;NEW&#35;.
     * &#35;NEW&#35; and #UNDER-CONSTRUCTION# macros are now included in
       the DocBook backend.
     * Replaced shipped smallnew.gif with smallnew.png.
     * Documentation tidy ups.
     __________________________________________________________________

52. Version 5.0.5 (2004-02-25)

     * Fixed the disappearing paragraph titles problem that was caused by
       Inline macros (incorrectly) processing BlockTitles.
     * Tightened AuthorLine validation. Previously invalid email addresses
       and embedded special characters in the AuthorLine resulted in
       invalid output markup.
     __________________________________________________________________

53. Version 5.0.4 (2004-02-09)

     * Reinstated missing infile, outfile, filetype and
       filetype-<filetype> glossary entries.
     * As of version 5.0.3 asciidoc(1) now requires Python 2.0 or greater,
       this has now been documented.
     __________________________________________________________________

54. Version 5.0.3 (2004-01-23)

     * Fixed problem that caused any filters directory file containing
       .conf (not just those with the .conf extension) from being loaded.
     * All [miscellaneous] configuration file entries can now be
       referenced like glossary entries (they are now processed internally
       as glossary entries).
     * The output file line terminator (previously hardwired to \r\n is
       now set using the newline entry in the configuration file
       [miscellaneous] section.
     * The misspelt blocktitles configuration file entry name has been
       corrected (to blocktitle).
     * An {empty} glossary entry has been added to the default
       configuration which is useful for outputting trailing blank lines
       from configuration file substitution sections.
     __________________________________________________________________

55. Version 5.0.2 (2003-12-18)

     * New (alternative) anchor and xref macro syntax (old syntax still
       valid).
     * DocBook mediaobject and inlinemediaobject tags are generated in
       place of graphic and inlinegraphic tags by the AsciiDoc graphic and
       icon macros. If a macro argument is specified it is the alternative
       text output if the target document format does not support the
       specified graphic file format.
     * Dropped the LinuxDoc left and right square bracket special
       character substitutions as they interfered with macro substitution.
     * Documentation updates and corrections.
     __________________________________________________________________

56. Version 5.0.1 (2003-12-09)

     * Fixed problem with anchor tag when generating CSS styled HTML.
     __________________________________________________________________

57. Version 5.0 (2003-12-08)

   This release has had some fairly major code and documentation changes.
   Please report any problems you encounter.

   [173]Stuart Rackham

     * AsciiDoc can now produce a full-blown multi-part DocBook book
       including dedication, abstract, preface, colophon, glossary,
       appendix, bibliography and book part elements using the new
       specialsections configuration file section.
     * All Section element children (Paragraph, DelimitedBlock, List,
       Table, BlockMacro) can now be titled using the BlockTitle element.
       A BlockTitle element is a single line containing a title and
       beginning with a period.
     * The index and backmatter macros have been dropped, superseded by
       specialsections.
     * The AsciiDoc Preface element has been renamed Preamble (to avoid
       confusion with the DocBook book preface element).
     * Out of sequence titles are now tolerated with a warning. This
       allows book document level 0 sections to be processed.
     * An anchor inline macro has been added for document link target
       creation.
     * Note, Tip, Important and Warning paragraph types have been added to
       support the corresponding DocBook elements.
     * Title substitution is now performed in SidebarBlock titles.
     * DocBook graphics now output as figure and informalfigure elements
       rather than mediaobjects. This ensures numbered figures and a lists
       of figures are produced by the DocBook toolchain.
     * You can now escape block argument lines by appending a backslash.
       Alternatively, if you embed arguments in the delimiter line
       AsciiDoc does not check for an arguments line.
     * The default DocBook backend file extension has been changed from
       .docbook to .xml (.sgml for the docbook-sgml backend).
     * Warnings are output by default (previously they only printed when
       verbose option enabled).
     * A Question and Answer variable list definition has been added to
       the shipped configuration files, primarily to create DocBook qanda
       DocBook elements.
     * Fixed broken code-filter -b linuxdoc option. The asciidoc.asc User
       Guide can now be processed by linuxdoc(1) (although tables are
       dropped because LinuxDoc does not implement tables).

   Compatibility issues:
    1. Table titles are no longer in the arguments line, use the new
       BlockTitles.
    2. Graphic titles are no longer in the graphic block macro caption,
       use the new BlockTitles.
    3. The code-filter title must be placed in a preceding BlockTitle.
    4. SidebarBlock titles must be placed in a preceding BlockTitle.
    5. The DelimitedBlock option sidebar has been renamed to section.
    6. The default DocBook backend file extension has been changed from
       .docbook to .xml (.sgml for the docbook-sgml backend).
     __________________________________________________________________

58. Version 4.2 (2003-11-26)

     * The default HTML output is now XHTML 1.0 markup. To output the
       former HTML 4 markup specify the html-4 backend.
     * The default DocBook output is now DocBook XML. To output the former
       DocBook SGML specify the docbook-sgml backend. The associated
       docbook-sgml.conf file illustrates how to support minor DTD
       variations. Examples of using the xmlto(1) command for DocBook
       conversion have been added to the User Guide.
     * Glossary entries set using the command-line -g option can now be
       referenced in configuration files.
     * Configuration dumps (-c command-line option) no longer output
       redundant undefined glossary entries.
     * DelimitedBlock arguments can now be specified in a separate
       arguments line immediately following the leading delimiter line,
       This is in preference to the existing delimiter embedded arguments.
       Reasons:
          + The syntax is in keeping with the Tables arguments syntax.
          + It’s easier to enter and implements line continuation.
     * A new QuoteBlock DelimitedBlock definition has been added to the
       distribution configuration files.
     * The table arguments lines can be continued using the backslash line
       continuation character.
     * Added new calculated glossary reference type {<name>%<value>}.
     * Double-quote characters can now appear in unquoted positional
       arguments.
     __________________________________________________________________

59. Version 4.1 (2003-11-13)

     * Added DSV (Delimiter Separated Values) tables format.
     * {eval:<expr>} glossary references drop the containing line if
       <expr> evaluates to None.
     * Block, Table and Macro arguments can now be positional (quoted or
       unquoted).
     * Vocabulary change: DelimitedBlock, Table and Macro attributes are
       now referred to as arguments. This makes more sense in light of the
       extended syntax and avoids confusion with backend markup tag
       attributes.
     * tablewidth table ruler parameter can now be expressed in percent
       units (0..100). If between 0 and 1 then the original fractional
       unit measure is applied.
     * The use of quoting for generating footnotes and index entries has
       been dropped in favor of footnote and indexterm inline macros.
     * backmatter inline macro included in distribution.
     * Fixed: CSS styled HTML tables are now fully XHTML 1.0 conformant.
     * Fixed: tablewidth was processed incorrectly when passed as table
       argument.
     * Fixed: Glossary references like {x=\{y}} were one character off if
       {x] was defined and {y} was not.
     __________________________________________________________________

60. Version 4.0 (2003-11-08)

   This release has had some fairly major code and documentation changes.
   Please report any problems you encounter.

   Stuart Rackham

     * Added tables to AsciiDoc.
     * Added two special subs options: default specifies the default
       substitution options and none specifies no substitution. These
       options can only appear singly.
     * Line continuation using a trailing backslash character is available
       in Paragraphs, ListItems, Tables.
     * The left and right quotes for quoted text can now be specified
       separately.
     * Shipped configuration files implement footnotes (only useful for
       DocBook output) using \[[]] quoting.
     * Shipped configuration files implement index terms (only useful for
       DocBook and LinuxDoc output) using \(()) quoting.
     * The shipped html backend configuration now emits valid HTML 4.01
       Transitional.
     * Added new calculated glossary reference types {<name>!<value>} and
       {<name>#<value>}.
     * The DelimitedBlock params option has been dropped in favor of the
       new block attributes mechanism. If you have customized block params
       options you may need to adjust source files to use the block
       attributes syntax. The example code filter has been updated to
       reflect these changes.
     * The code filter now has a -t tabsize option.
     * Replaced -w option with -v (verbose) option. The warnings option
       was just to confusing.
     * Named attributes can now be specified in macro calls.
     * The tabsize attribute is recognized in the built-in include macros.
       A tabsize of zero suppresses tab expansion.
     * The configuration file [options] section has been split into
       [miscellaneous] and [titles]. If you have customized any of these
       settings you will need to adjust the affected configuration files.
     * Configuration file [miscellaneous] entries can now also be set
       using the command-line -g option.
     * Fixed: error that occurred when attempting to use zero length
       configuration and source files.
     * Fixed: blocking filter halt problem.
     * Fixed: inline macro escape prefix problem.
     * Fixed: missing macros from configuration dump problem.
     * Fixed: named macros were dumped incorrectly.
     * Many documentation changes/additions/corrections.
     __________________________________________________________________

61. Version 3.2.2 (2003-10-26)

     * Added -n option (synonym for -g section-numbers).
     * Dropped the processing commentary (hey, this is Unix).
     * Added new calculated glossary reference type {<name>?<value>}.
       <name> is the glossary entry name and <value> is the text
       substituted if the glossary entry is defined. <value> can only
       contain literal text (no glossary references allowed).
     * Added asciidoc2text to distribution examples/asciidoc2text
       directory (converts AsciiDoc source to text file with section
       numbering).
     * Fixed incorrect nesting of Simple lists inside Variable lists.
     * List definitions have been modified so that list items can be
       indented. This allows a more intuitive indentation of nested lists
       in AsciiDoc source.
     * Lists must be separated from preceding paragraphs by a blank line.
       This is to avoid paragraph lines being mistaken for list items.
     * Corrected asciidoc man page documentation error: the`-f` option
       does not search relative to source document directory for the
       configuration file.
     * Minor updates to various distribution .conf files.
     * Included badges.conf in examples directory.
     * css-embedded-stylesheet.conf now supports footer badges.
     * The default in-line element processing order has been changed:
       Glossary References are now processed before Inline Macros. This
       allows glossary expansions to occur inside macro references.
     * Glossary entries are now allowed in Author and Revision lines.
     * Default List subs options and Paragraph presubs options are
       assigned the following default value if not specified:
  specialcharacters,quotes,specialwords,replacements,glossary,macros
     * Documentation changes/additions/corrections.
     __________________________________________________________________

62. Version 3.2 (2003-05-26)

     * Added a -s command-line option to suppress the output of [header]
       and [footer] sections.
     * Article document headers are no longer mandatory: this allows
       AsciiDoc to process arbitrary chunks of text. When used in
       conjunction with the new -s command-line option corresponding
       chunks of backend markup can be generated.
     * AsciiDoc now emits a warning message and continues when an out of
       sequence section title is detected (previously it failed and
       halted). This allows document sections to be processed separately.
     * Optional presubs and postsubs entries have been added to
       DelimitedBlock and Paragraph definitions. As a consequence
       substitution options are no longer legal in options entries.
     * presubs and postsubs substitutions are processed in the order the
       options are specified (rather than the fixed options order of
       previous versions).
     * ./filters subdirectories are automatically searched for filter
       commands.
     * A title-subs configuration option specifies the substitutions
       performed on document Header and Section titles.
     * A subs entry in now included in List configuration file definitions
       that specified substitutions performed on list entry text.
     * Configuration files are auto-loaded from ./filters subdirectories.
     * Added example code filter (see ./examples/filters).
     * Bug fix: if section was empty you may have got erroneous missing
       tag "paragraph" error.
     * Internal code tidy up.
     __________________________________________________________________

63. Version 3.1 (2003-05-18)

     * In version 3.0 a [macros] section entry of the form name was
       equivalent to name=. An entry of the form name now undefines the
       entry (to bring it in line with the behavior of other special
       sections).
     * Paragraphs have now been generalized (in the same way as Lists and
       DelimitedBlocks).
     * The indentsize option has been dropped as as consequence of
       paragraph generalization.
     * Pipe | characters can be included in substituted tag and
       substitution section text using the {brvbar} (broken vertical bar)
       glossary reference.
     * Removed the restriction requiring substitution section text
       placeholders | to be on a separate line.
     * Added an -e asciidoc(1) command option that excludes implicit
       configuration files (used in conjunction with -c generated
       configuration files).
     * Version 3.0 documentation has undergone a considerable cleanup.
     * The dumping of quoted section entries (see -c option) now works
       correctly.
     * The format of special section entries has been made consistent:
       name undefines the entry; name= sets the entry value to a blank
       string; name=value sets the entry value to value.
     * As a consequence of the previous change the caret prefix is no
       longer used in glossary configuration file entries (although it is
       still used when undefining an entry using the -g command-line
       option).
     __________________________________________________________________

64. Version 3.0 (2003-05-13)

   This version is the culmination of work begun in the 2.x releases
   whereby fixed policy has been replaced by extensible mechanisms.
     * Added -c command-line option to dump a composite asciidoc(1)
       configuration file to stdout.
     * Lists and Delimited Blocks are now defined by a set of
       configuration file parameter sections. The user can modify the
       default definitions or add new ones.
     * Block content can now be processed through external filters.
     * The default behavior for Custom Blocks is to perform glossary
       substitution (previously there was no substitution inside Custom
       Blocks).
     * The old 2.x style macros have been reimplemented; as with Lists and
       Delimited Blocks there syntax and behavior can be configured by the
       user. The default macro syntax remains the same but the semantics
       are now (hopefully) a bit more intelligible.
     * Block and Builtin macros use :: delimiter instead of the 2.x single
       colon delimit (to distinguish them from inline macros). The 2.x
       syntax is still supported for backward compatibility.
     * Nested lists are now supported and IndentedParagraphs can be
       included in list items.
     * Conditional source inclusion can be specified using built in ifdef,
       ifndef and endif macros.
     * The new conditional source inclusion feature has been used to
       reduce the number of default configuration files down to one per
       backend.
     * A change of name: 2.x Substitutions are now called Replacements and
       the 2.x [substitutions] configuration file section is now called
       [replacements] (the old name is still recognized for backward
       compatibility).
     * The line break is now implemented as a Replacements substitution.
     * Inline icon macro for inline images has been added to default
       configuration files.
     __________________________________________________________________

65. Version 2.2 (2003-04-07)

     * The master.conf configuration file name has been deprecated in
       favor of asciidoc.conf.
     * The standard configuration files set is now loaded from the
       .asciidoc folder in the users home directory (if it exists) and
       then from the source document directory. Configuration files that
       don’t exist are silently skipped.
     * Configuration files named like the source file will be
       automatically loaded if they are found in the source file
       directory. For example if the source file is mydoc.asc and the -b
       html option is used then asciidoc(1) will look for mydoc.conf and
       mydoc-html.conf in that order.
     * The characters used to quote formatted text can be configured and
       extended by the user (see the master.conf [quotes] section).
     * Quoted text can now be escaped by prefixing a backslash character
       to the leading quote.
     * The double single-quote '' strong text quote has been deprecated in
       favor of an asterisk * character.
     * Added {eval:expression}, {sys:command} and {sys2:command} glossary
       reference actions.
     * Trailing brace characters } are now allowed inside glossary
       references provided they are escaped with a backslash character.
     * Glossary entries can now be escaped by prefixing a backslash
       character to the leading brace character (use this in preference to
       placing the backslash inside the brace).
     * The output macro has been deprecated (use the new include1 macro
       inside a CustomBlock).
     * The default document type is article (asciidoc no longer attempts
       to guess).
     * Files included within DelimitedBlocks are not searched for block
       termination underlines. This ensures the entire file is part of the
       DelimitedBlock.
     * include macros can now be used in configuration files.
     * Corrected {infile} and {outfile} glossary entry documentation.
     * File inclusion is now limited to a depth of 5 to catch recursion
       loops.
     * Inline tags have been deprecated, they’re not necessary and they
       immediately make the source document backend specific. Use
       CustomBlocks or Substitutions instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

66. Version 2.1 (2003-03-17)

     * Added section auto numbering {sectnum} glossary entry
       (auto-numbering function contributed by Ludovico Magnocavallo).
     * asciidoc(1) now correctly returns non-zero exit status if an error
       occurs.
     * An AsciiDoc example website has been included in the AsciiDoc
       distribution examples/website directory.
     * NOTE: The asciidoc wrapper script included in the 2.0 distribution
       has been dropped, if you’ve symlinked or aliased to asciidoc you’ll
       need to change them to point directly to asciidoc.py instead.
     * An RCS $Id$ marker can be used as the document header revision line
       (based on a patch submitted by Ludovico Magnocavallo).
     * In addition to the name=value glossary entry format two new ones
       have been introduced: name (the default value is set to an empty
       string) and ^name (the glossary entry is undefined).
     * The -q command-line option has been deprecated and the -w level
       command-line option added.
       NOTE: By default skipped substitution warnings are now suppressed.
     * If a configuration file specified with the -f command-line option
       is not found relative to the current working directory then the
       search is repeated relative to the asciidoc(1) directory. This
       allows global configuration files to be used.
     * Added {infile}, {outfile} predefined glossary entries.
     * Added under-construction macro to HTML article configuration files.
     * Deprecated {asciidoc_version} glossary entry in favor of
       {asciidoc-version} (to it consistent with other entries).
     __________________________________________________________________

67. Version 2.0 (2003-02-24)

     * The emphasized, strong and monospaced words options have been
       generalized with the introduction of macro based special words
       lists.
     * Glossary references can now appear in both the document and macro
       bodies.
     * All output files use crlf line termination (previously used UNIX lf
       (newline) termination).
     * Added [substitutions] section which implements arbitrary regular
       expression based substitutions.
     * An optional master.conf configuration file can be used for entries
       that are not backend or document type specific.
     * Special character definitions moved from the code to the new
       [special_characters] configuration file section.
     * Configuration file glossary added.
     * Command-line -g glossary entry added.
     * A new book document type has been implemented for the docbook
       backend. It outputs DocBook book documents.
     * A major internal change has been the implementation of parametrized
       user definable macros. Internally most document elements are now
       processed as macros.
     * Configuration file macro variables can be specified with default
       values (literals or other macro variables).
     * An attempt has been made to tighten up the vocabulary used to
       describe the AsciiDoc document syntax.
     * The term abstract has been replaced by the more general term
       preface and a new preface section introduced into article
       configuration files (replacing the synopsis sections).
     * Any section elements can now be put in the document preface
       (previous versions only allowed paragraphs).
     * AsciiDoc Blocks have been unified and their behavior can be user
       defined and parametrized.
     * An output inclusion allows an external file to be written directly
       to the backend output file.
     * A new CustomBlock has been added. Default behavior is to insert the
       enveloped AsciiDoc source lines directly into the output file.
     * A line break tag can be inserted by terminating a line with a +
       character (only really useful for HTML backends).
     * An fourth section level has been introduced.
     * The SidebarBlock delimiter line characters have been changed. The
       deprecated underline is still accepted.
     * Levels 2 and 3 title underline characters have been changed. The
       deprecated underlines are still accepted.
     * Lines with backend specific inline tags can be inserted into
       AsciiDoc source files.
     * Single words enveloped by underscores are no longer emphasized.
       This feature was deprecated as it is redundant (use single quotes
       instead) and was being applied to file names with underscores.
     * A -q quiet option has been added to suppress warning messages.
     * Badge images sourced locally.
     * Added author and author-mail meta tags to HTML configuration files.
     __________________________________________________________________

68. Version 1.5 (2003-01-08)

     * Implemented sidebar document elements.
     * Explicit checks for user specified configuration files and input
       file (rather than throwing exception).
     __________________________________________________________________

69. Version 1.4 (2003-01-04)

     * New configuration file options emphasizedwords and strongwords.
       These allow the definition of words that will always be emphasized
       or rendered in a strong font without inline formatting.
     * Document and section titles are no long subject to inline
       formatting.
     * Multiple configuration files can be overlaid in a single command.
     * Configuration file tags and options entries can now be overridden
       on an entry by entry basis (previously the entire section was
       overloaded).
     * Configuration file tags and options entries are now cached this has
       resulted in around 37% performance improvement over version 1.3.
     * Variable lists can now contain multiple terms per list item.
     * Placeholder paragraph eliminated from empty sections that contain
       subsections.
     * Added {asciidoc_version} substitution variable.
     * More documentation additions and tidy ups.
     __________________________________________________________________

70. Version 1.3 (2003-01-01)

     * A new strong text formatting convention has been implemented: Word
       phrases enclosed in pairs of single quote characters (acute
       accents) are rendered in a strong font (usually bold).
     * Paragraphs can now be followed immediately by Simple lists and
       Ordered lists without an intervening blank line.
     * A user specified configuration file (asciidoc(1) -f option)
       overlays the default configuration file rather than replacing it.
       Custom configuration files need only contain those sections that
       have been customized.
     * Comment Block delimiters have been relaxed slightly. They must
       start with three forward slashes /// but the remainder can contain
       any characters, this allows comments to be embedded in the
       delimiter line.
     * Leading non-digit characters preceding revision number are now
       ignored.
     * Set default indentsize [option] from 2 to documented default value
       of zero in HTML backend html-article.conf and html-manpage.conf
       files.
     * Fixed error that occurred when taking input from stdin without
       explicitly specifying a document type.
     * Restored file name and line number error message information.
     * Changed deprecated -t option to -d in asciidoc --help and usage
       command output.
     * CSS styles tweaking.
     * Code, configuration file and documentation tidy ups.
     __________________________________________________________________

71. Version 1.2 (2002-12-28)

     * Implemented include URL to allow file inclusion.
     * fileextension configuration file [option] renamed to more sensible
       outfilesuffix (fileextension still accepted by this version but
       will be dropped in future).
     * Improved error reporting.
     * CSS backends generate valid XHTML.
     * New css-embedded backend generates HTML with embedded stylesheets
       (use the css backend for linked stylesheets). The css-embedded
       backend output contains no linked images so the generated html
       files are completely self contained.
     * Bug fixes.
     __________________________________________________________________

72. Version 1.1 (2002-12-03)

     * Added css (cascading style sheets) backend
     * Implemented IndentedBlock document element.
     * Tabsize command-line option has been deprecated in favor of
       configuration file.
     * Default indent width changed to zero.
     * Added {localdate} and {localtime} substitution variables.
     * Added optional [options] configuration file section with
       fileextension, tabsize and indentsize options.
     * Implemented {authorinitials} substitution variable.
     * Added https link type.
     * Corrected [graphic] substitution from {title} to {caption} in
       linuxdoc-article.conf configuration file.
     * Fixed error that occurred when == title underline was used.
     __________________________________________________________________

73. Version 1.0 (2002-11-25)

   First AsciiDoc public release along with AsciiDoc web site
   ([174]http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) and SourceForge.net project
   registration ([175]https://sourceforge.net/projects/asciidoc/).
