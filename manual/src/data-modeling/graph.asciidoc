Graph Design
============
The syntax of a graph can express anything; the structure of a particular graph should make it easy to express the semantics of a domain.


== Nodes & Relationships ==

Nodes are simple entities which form compound structures through Relationships. 
Both Nodes and Relationships are property containers.

== Single Node ==

The simplest graph possible has a single Node.

== Node Collection ==

A graph may contain an arbitrary number of Nodes.

== Ordered Structure ==

The nodes within a graph may be connected with Relationships to form compound structures.

== Compound Structure ==

== External Index ==
