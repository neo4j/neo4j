System Requirements
===================

Memory constrains graph size, disk I/O constrains read/write performance, as always. 

== CPU ==

Performance is generally memory or I/O bound for large graphs, and compute bound for graphs which fit in memory.

Minimum::      Intel 486
Recommended::  Intel Core i7


== Memory ==

More memory allows even larger graphs, but runs the risk of inducing larger Garbage Collection operations.

Minimum::     1GB
Recommended:: 4-8GB

== Disk ==

Aside from capacity, the performance characteristics of the disk are the most important when selecting storage.

Minimum::     SCSI, EIDE 
Recommended:: SSD w/ SATA

== Filesystem ==

For proper ACID behavior, the filesystem must support flush (fsync, fdatasync).

Minimum::      ext3 (or similar)
Recommended::  ext4, ZFS

== Software ==

Neo4j is Java-based.

Java:: Oracle Java 6
Operating Systems:: Linux, Windows XP, Mac OS X

== JDK Version ==

The Neo4j runtime is continuously tested with
