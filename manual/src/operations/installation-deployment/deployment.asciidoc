Deployment Scenarios
====================

Neo4j can be embedded into your application, run as a standalone server or deployed on several machines to provide high availability. 

.Neo4j deployment options
[cols="h,,", options="header"]
|=========================================================================
|            | Single Instance       | Multiple Instances
| Embedded   | EmbeddedGraphDatabase | HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase
| Standalone | Neo4j Server          | Neo4j Server high availability mode
|=========================================================================

== Server ==

Neo4j is normally accessed as a standalone server, either directly through a REST interface or through a language-specific driver.
More information about Neo4j server is found in <<server>>.
For running the server and embedded installations in high availability mode, see <<ha>>.

== Embedded ==

Neo4j can be embedded directly in a server application by including the appropriate Java libraries.
When programming, you can refer to the +http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/GraphDatabaseService.html[GraphDatabaseService]+ API.
To switch from a single instance to multiple highly available instances, simply switch from the concrete +http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/kernel/EmbeddedGraphDatabase.html[EmbeddedGraphDatabase]+ to the +http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-enterprise/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/kernel/HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase.html[HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase]+.
