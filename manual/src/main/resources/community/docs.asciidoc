Writing Neo4j Documentation
===========================

NOTE: Other than writing documentation, you can help out by providing comments - head over to the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/[online HTML version] to do that!

For how to build the manual see:
https://github.com/neo4j/manual/blob/master/README.asciidoc[readme]

The documents use the asciidoc format, see:

* http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Aciidoc Reference]
* http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc cheatsheet]

The cheatsheet is really useful!

[[community-docs-overall-flow]]
== Overall Flow ==

Each (sub)project has its own documentation, which will produce a 'docs.jar' file.
By default this file is assembled from the contents in 'src/docs/'.
Asciidoc documents have the +.txt+ file extension.

The documents can use code snippets which will extract code from the project.
The corresponding code must be deployed to the 'sources.jar' or 'test-sources.jar' file.

By setting up a unit test accordingly, documentation can be written directly in the JavaDoc comment.

The above files are all consumed by the build of the manual (by adding them as dependencies).
To get content included in the manual, it has to be explicitly included by a document in the manual as well.

Note that different ways to add documentation works best for different cases:

* For detail level documentation, it works well to write the documentation as part of unit tests (in the JavaDoc comment).
  In this case, you typically do not want to link to the source code in the documentation.
* For tutorial level documentation, the result will be best by writing a +.txt+ file containing the text.
  Source snippets and output examples can then be included from there.
  In this case you typically want to link to the source code, and users should be able to run it without any special setup.

== File Structure in 'docs.jar' ==

[options="header", cols="e,d"]
|========================
| Directory | Contents
| dev/ | content aimed at developers
| dev/images/ | images used by the dev docs
| ops/ | content aimed at operations
| ops/images/ | images used by the ops docs
| man/ | manpages
|========================

Additional subdirectories are used as needed to structure the documents,
like 'dev/tutorial/', 'ops/tutorial/' etc.

== Headings and document structure ==

Each document starts over with headings from level zero (the document title).
Each document should have an id.
In some cases sections in the document need to have id's as well, this depends on where they fit in the overall structure.
To be able to link to content, it has to have an id.
Missing id's in mandatory places will fail the build.

This is how a document should start:

[source]
----
[[unique-id-verbose-is-ok]]
The Document Title
==================
----

To push the headings down to the right level in the output, the +leveloffset+ 
attribute is used when including the document inside of another document.

Subsequent headings in a document should use the following syntax:

[source]
----
== Subheading ==

... content here ...

=== Subsubheading ===

content here ...

----

Asciidoc comes with one more syntax for headings, but in this project it's not used.

== Writing ==

Put one sentence on each line.
This makes it easy to move content around, and also easy to spot (too) long sentences.

== Gotchas ==

* A chapter can't be empty. (the build will fail on the docbook xml validity check)
* The document title should be "underlined" by the same
  number of +=+ as there are characters in the title.
* Always leave a blank line at the end of documents
  (or the title of the next document might end up in the last
  paragraph of the document)
* As +{}+ are used for Asciidoc attributes, everything inside will be treated as an attribute.
  What you have to do is to escape the opening brace: +\\{+.
  If you don't, the braces and the text inside them will be removed without any warning being issued!

== Links ==

To link to other parts of the manual the id of the target is used.
This is how such a reference looks:

[source]
----
<<community-docs-overall-flow>>
----

Which will render like: <<community-docs-overall-flow>>

[NOTE]
Just write "see \<<target-id>>" and similar, that should suffice in most cases.

If you need to link to another document with your own link text, this is what to do:

[source]
----
<<target-id, link text that fits in the context>>
----

NOTE: Having lots of linked text may work well in a web context but is a pain in print, and we aim for both!

External links are added like this:

[source]
----
http://neo4j.org/[Link text here]
----

Which renders like: http://neo4j.org/[Link text here]

For short links it may be better not to add a link text, just do:

[source]
----
http://neo4j.org/
----

Which renders like: http://neo4j.org/

NOTE: It's ok to have a dot right after the URL, it won't be part of the link.

== Text Formatting ==

* \_Italics_ is rendered as _Italics_ and used for emphasis.
* \*Bold* is rendered as *Bold* and used sparingly, for strong emphasis only.
* \+methodName()+ is rendered as +methodName()+ and is used for literals as well
  (note: the content between the `+` signs _will_ be parsed).
* \`command` is rendered as `command` (typically used for command-line)
  (note: the content between the +`+ signs _will not_ be parsed).
* \'my/path/' is rendered as 'my/path/' (used for file names and paths).
* \\``Double quoted'' (that is two grave accents to the left and two acute accents to the right) renders as ``Double quoted''.
* \`Single quoted' (that is a single grave accent to the left and a single acute accent to the right) renders as `Single quoted'.

== Admonitions ==

These are very useful and should be used where appropriate.
Choose from the following (write all caps and no, we can't easily add new ones):

NOTE: Note.

TIP: Tip.

IMPORTANT: Important

CAUTION: Caution

WARNING: Warning

Here's how it's done:

[source]
----
NOTE: Note.
----

A multiline variation:

[source]
----
[TIP]
Tiptext.
Line 2.
----

Which is rendered as:

[TIP]
Tiptext.
Line 2.

== Images ==

IMPORTANT: _All images in the entire manual share the same namespace._
  You know how to handle that.

=== Images Files ===

To include an image file, make sure it resides in the 'images/' directory relative to the document you're including it from. Then go:

[source]
----
image::neo4j-logo.png[]
----

Which is rendered as:

image::neo4j-logo.png[]

=== Static Graphviz/DOT ===

We use the Graphviz/DOT language to describe graphs.
For documentation see http://graphviz.org/.

This is how to include a simple example graph:

[source]
----
 ["dot", "community-docs-graphdb-rels.svg"]
 ----
 "Start node" -> "End node" [label="relationship"]
 ----
----

Which is rendered as:

["dot", "community-docs-graphdb-rels.svg"]
----
"Start node" -> "End node" [label="relationship"]
----

Here's an example using some predefined variables available in the build:

[source]
----
 ["dot", "community-docs-graphdb-rels-overview.svg", "meta"]
 ----
 "A Relationship" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
 "Start node" [fillcolor="NODE2HIGHLIGHT"]
 "A Relationship" -> "Start node" [label="has a"]
 "A Relationship" -> "End node" [label="has a"]
 "A Relationship" -> "Relationship type" [label="has a"]
 Name [TEXTNODE]
 "Relationship type" -> Name [label="uniquely identified by" color="EDGEHIGHLIGHT" fontcolor="EDGEHIGHLIGHT"]
 ----
----

Which is rendered as:

["dot", "community-docs-graphdb-rels-overview.svg", "meta"]
----
"A Relationship" [fillcolor="NODEHIGHLIGHT"]
"Start node" [fillcolor="NODE2HIGHLIGHT"]
"A Relationship" -> "Start node" [label="has a"]
"A Relationship" -> "End node" [label="has a"]
"A Relationship" -> "Relationship type" [label="has a"]
Name [TEXTNODE]
"Relationship type" -> Name [label="uniquely identified by" color="EDGEHIGHLIGHT" fontcolor="EDGEHIGHLIGHT"]
----

The optional second argument given to the dot filter defines the style to use:

* when not defined: Default styling for nodespace examples.
* +neoviz+: Nodespace view generated by Neoviz.
* +meta+: Graphs that don't resemble db contents, but rather concepts.

CAUTION: Keywords of the DOT language have to be surrounded by double quotes when used for other purposes.
  The keywords include _node, edge, graph, digraph, subgraph,_ and _strict_.


== Attributes ==

Common attributes you can use in documents:

* \{neo4j-version} - rendered as "{neo4j-version}"
* \{neo4j-git-tag} - rendered as "{neo4j-git-tag}"
* \{lucene-version} - rendered as "{lucene-version}"

These can substitute part of URLs that point to for example APIdocs or source code.
Note that neo4j-git-tag also handles the case of snapshot/master.

Sample Asciidoc attributes which can be used:

* \{docdir} - root directory of the documents
* \{nbsp} - non-breaking space

== Comments ==

There's a separate build including comments.
The comments show up with a yellow background.
This build doesn't run by default, but after a normal build, you can use `make annotated` to build it.
You can also use the resulting page to search for content, as the full manual is on a single page.

Here's how to write a comment:

[source]
----
// this is a comment
----

The comments are not visible in the normal build.
Comment blocks won't be included in the output of any build at all.
Here's a comment block:

[source]
----
////
Note that includes in here will still be processed, but not make it into the output.
That is, missing includes here will still break the build!
////
----


== Code Snippets ==

=== Explicitly defined in the document ===

WARNING: Use this kind of code snippets as little as possible.
  They are well known to get out of sync with reality after a while.

This is how to do it:

[source]
----
 [source,cypher]
 ----
 start n=(2, 1) where (n.age < 30 and n.name = "Tobias") or not(n.name = "Tobias")  return n
 ----
----

Which is rendered as:

[source,cypher]
----
start n=(2, 1) where (n.age < 30 and n.name = "Tobias") or not(n.name = "Tobias")  return n
----

If there's no suitable syntax highlighter, just omit the language: +[source]+.

Currently the following syntax highlighters are enabled:

* Bash
* Cypher
* Groovy
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* XML

For other highlighters we could add see http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/.


=== Fetched from source code ===

Code can be automatically fetched from source files.
You need to define:

* component: the +artifactId+ of the Maven coordinates,
* source: path to the file inside the jar it's deployed to,
* classifier: +sources+ or +test-sources+ or any other classifier pointing to the artifact,
* tag: tag name to search the file for,
* the language of the code, if a corresponding syntax highlighter is available.

Note that the artifact has to be included as a Maven dependency of the Manual project so that the files can be found.

The file will be searched for lines including +START SNIPPET: {tag}+ and +END SNIPPET: {tag}+, the lines between those will go into the output. 
Be aware of that the tag "abc" will match "abcd" as well.
It's a simple on/off switch, meaning that multiple occurrences will be assembled into a single code snippet in the output.
This behavior can be user to hide away assertions from code examples sourced from tests.

This is how to define a code snippet inclusion:

[source]
----
 [snippet,java]
 ----
 component=neo4j-examples
 source=org/neo4j/examples/JmxTest.java
 classifier=test-sources
 tag=getStartTime
 ----
----

This is how it renders:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-examples
source=org/neo4j/examples/JmxTest.java
classifier=test-sources
tag=getStartTime
----


=== Query Results ===

There's a special filter for Cypher query results.
This is how to tag a query result:

[source]
----
 .Result
 [queryresult]
 ----
 +----------------------------------+
 | friend_of_friend.name | count(*) |
 +----------------------------------+
 | Ian                   | 2        |
 | Derrick               | 1        |
 | Jill                  | 1        |
 +----------------------------------+
 3 rows, 12 ms
 ----
----

This is how it renders:

.Result
[queryresult]
----
+----------------------------------+
| friend_of_friend.name | count(*) |
+----------------------------------+
| Ian                   | 2        |
| Derrick               | 1        |
| Jill                  | 1        |
+----------------------------------+
3 rows, 12 ms
----


== A sample Java based documentation test ==

For Java, there are a couple of premade utilities that keep code and documentation together in
Javadocs and code snippets that generate Asciidoc for the rest of the toolchain.

To illustrate this, look at the following documentation that generates the Asciidoc file +hello-world-title.txt+ with a content of:

[source]
------------------------------
include::{importdir}/neo4j-examples-docs-jar/dev/examples/hello-world-sample-chapter.txt[]
------------------------------

this file is included in this documentation via

[source]
----
  :leveloffset: 3
  include::{importdir}/neo4j-examples-docs-jar/dev/examples/hello-world-sample-chapter.txt[] 
----

which renders the following chapter: 

:leveloffset: 3

include::{importdir}/neo4j-examples-docs-jar/dev/examples/hello-world-sample-chapter.txt[]

:leveloffset: 2

== Integrated Live Console ==

An interactive console can be added and will show up in the online HTML version.
An optional title can be added, which will be used for the text of the button.

This is how to do it, using Geoff to define the data, with an empty line to separate it from the query:

[source]
----
 .Interactive Matrix Example
 [console]
 ----
 (A) {"name" : "Neo"}; 
 (B) {"name" : "Trinity"};
 (A)-[:LOVES]->(B)

 start n = node(*)
 return n
 ----
----

And this is the result:

.Interactive Matrix Example
[console]
----
(A) {"name" : "Neo"};
(B) {"name" : "Trinity"};
(A)-[:LOVES]->(B)

start n = node(*)
return n
----
