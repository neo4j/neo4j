== Relationships ==

Relationships are a first class citizen in the Neo4j REST API. They can be accessed either
stand-alone or through the nodes they are attached to.

The general pattern to get relationships from a node is:
[source]
GET http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/123/relationships/{dir}/{-list|&|types}

Where +dir+ is one of +all+, +in+, +out+ and +types+ is an ampersand-separated list of types.
