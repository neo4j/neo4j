== Using the REST API from WebLogic ==

When deploying an application to WebLogic you may run into problems when Neo4j responds with an HTTP status of `204 No Content`.
The response does not contain an entity body in such cases.

This can cause WebLogic to throw
`java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out`
for no obvious reason.

If you encounter this, please try setting `UseSunHttpHandler` to `true`.
You can for example do this by adding the following to the WebLogic startup script:

[source,properties]
----
-DUseSunHttpHandler=true
----

The WebLogic startup script is called `bin\startWebLogic.sh` (`bin/startWebLogic.cmd` on Windows).
