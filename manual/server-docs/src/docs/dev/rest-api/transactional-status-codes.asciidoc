[[status-codes]]
== Neo4j Status Codes ==

The transactional endpoint may in any response include zero or more status codes, indicating issues or information for
the client. Each status code follows the same format: "Neo.[Classification].[Category].[Title]". The fact
that a status code is returned by the server does always mean there is a fatal error. Status codes can also indicate
transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.

What the effect of the status code is can be determined by its classification.

[NOTE]
This is not the same thing as HTTP status codes. Neo4j Status Codes are returned in the response body, at the very end
of the response.
