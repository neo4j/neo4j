[[rest-api-batch-ops]]
== Batch operations ==

[abstract]
Batch operations lets you execute multiple API calls through a single HTTP call.
This improves performance for large insert and update operations significantly.

This service is _transactional._
If any of the operations performed fails (returns a non-2xx HTTP status code), the transaction will be rolled back and no changes will be applied.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use this resource to execute Cypher queries with +USING PERIODIC COMMIT+.
