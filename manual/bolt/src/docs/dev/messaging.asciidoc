== Messaging layer

This section discusses the semantic meaning and layout of protocol messages.
For details on how Neo4j types are represented in binary form, see <<bolt-serialization,serialization>>.

Clients may send request messages at any time after a session is <<bolt-message-structs-initialize,initialized>>.
Clients may <<bolt-messaging-pipelining,pipeline>> requests, sending multiple requests together.

Servers must fully respond to each request before the next request is processed and processing of requests within a session must be done in the same order in which the requests.

Servers must ignore messages sent by the client after a failure occurs on the server, until the client has acknowledged the failure. See Failure & Acknowledgement.

For each request message sent, clients must anticipate receiving zero or more detail messages followed by exactly one summary message.
The detail messages deliver the response content, while a summary message denotes the end of the response and any response metadata.
Note that "detail" and "summary" are classifications of message, not specific message types.
For example, `RECORD` messages are classed as detail messages and `SUCCESS` messages as summary messages.

The diagrams below illustrates a basic exchange wherein the client sends a request message and receives a series of response messages.

=== Initialization

Before a session can be used to <<bolt-message-structs-run,run>> queries, it must be <<bolt-message-structs-initialize,initialized>>.
The `INIT` message should be sent by the client as the first message it sends after <<bolt-handshake,negotiating
protocol version>>.

[[bolt-messaging-pipelining]]
=== Pipelining

The client is not required to wait for a response before sending more messages.
Sending multiple messages together like this is called pipelining:

image:pipelining.png[]

For performance reasons, it is recommended that clients use pipelining as much as possible.
Through pipelining, multiple messages can be transmitted together in the same network package, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.

TIP: A common technique is to buffer outgoing messages on the client until the last possible moment, such as when a
commit is issued or a result is read by the application, and then sending all messages in the buffer together.

=== Failure handling

Because the protocol leverages pipelining, the client and the server need to agree on what happens when a failure
occurs, otherwise messages that were sent assuming no failure would occur might have unintended effects.

When requests fail on the server, the server will send the client a `FAILURE` message.
The client must acknowledge the `FAILURE` message by sending an `RESET` message to the server.
Until the server receives the `RESET` message, it will send an `IGNORED` message in response to any other message from by the client, including messages that were sent in a pipeline.
The `RESET` clears the pending failure state, disposes of any outstanding records and rolls back the current transaction (if any).

The diagram below illustrates a typical flow involving `RESET` messages:

image:failure-reset.png[]

Here, the original failure is acknowledged immediately by the client, allowing the subsequent RUN to be actioned as expected.

This second diagram shows a sequence where a pair of request messages are sent together:

image:failure-optimistic.png[]

Here, the client optimistically sends a pair of messages. The first of these fails and the second is consequently `IGNORED`.
Once the client acknowledges the failure, it is then able to resend a corrected RUN message.


[[bolt-message-structs]]
=== Messages

Protocol messages are represented as <<bolt-packstream-structures,serialized structures>>.

[[bolt-message-structs-initialize]]
==== INIT

The `INIT` message is a client message used once to initialize the session.
This message is always the first message the client sends after <<bolt-handshake,negotiating protocol version>>.
Sending any message other than `INIT` as the first message to the server will result in a `FAILURE` and the
server closing the connection.

All parameters in the `INIT` message are required.

.Response
- `SUCCESS {}` if initialization has completed successfully
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if the request was malformed, or if initialization cannot be performed at this time, or if the authorization failed.

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
InitMessage (signature=0x01) {
    String clientName
    Map<String,Value> authToken
}
----

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: INIT "MyClient/1.0" { "scheme": "basic", "principal": "neo4j", "credentials": "secret"}

B1 01 8C 4D  79 43 6C 69  65 6E 74 2F  31 2E 30 A3
86 73 63 68  65 6D 65 85  62 61 73 69  63 89 70 72
69 6E 63 69  70 61 6C 85  6E 65 6F 34  6A 8B 63 72
65 64 65 6E  74 69 61 6C  73 86 73 65  63 72 65 74
----

.Initialize message parameters
[cols="20,80",options="header"]
|=======================
|Parameter   |Description
|clientName  |A name and version for the client, if the user has allowed usage data collection, this is used to track popular clients. Example: "MyClient/1.0"
|authToken   |An authorization token used to authenticate to the database. The token must contain either just the entry { "scheme" : "none" } or the keys scheme, principal, and credentials. Example { "scheme": "basic", "principal": "neo4j", "credentials": "secret"}". If no scheme is provided, it defaults to "none".
|=======================

[[bolt-message-structs-run]]
==== RUN

The `RUN` message is a client message used to pass a Cypher statement for execution on the server. It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
RunMessage (signature=0x10) {
    String             statement
    Map<String,Value>  parameters
}
----

On receipt of a `RUN` message, the server will start a new job by executing the statement with the parameters supplied.
If successful, the subsequent response will consist of a single `SUCCESS` message; if not, a `FAILURE` response will be sent instead.
A successful job will always produce a result stream which must then be explicitly consumed (via `PULL_ALL` or `DISCARD_ALL`), even if empty.

Depending on the statement you are executing, additional metadata may be returned in both the `SUCCESS` message from the `RUN`, as well as in the final `SUCCESS` after the stream has been consumed.
It is up to the statement you are running to determine what meta data to return.
Notably, most queries will contain a 'fields' metadata section in the `SUCCESS` message for the `RUN` statement, which lists the result record field names.
We list further examples of meta data in the <<bolt-examples,examples section>>.

In the case where a previous result stream has not yet been fully consumed, an attempt to `RUN` a new job will trigger a `FAILURE` response.

If an unacknowledged failure is pending from a previous exchange, the server will immediately respond with a single
`IGNORED` message and take no further action.

.Response
- `SUCCESS {"fields": ...}` if the statement has been accepted for execution
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if the request was malformed or if a statement may not be executed at this time

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: RUN "RETURN 1 AS num" {}

B2 10 8F 52  45 54 55 52  4E 20 31 20  41 53 20 6E  75 6D A0
----

==== DISCARD_ALL

The `DISCARD_ALL` message is a client message used to discard all remaining items from the active result
stream. It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
DiscardAllMessage (signature=0x2F) {
}
----

On receipt of a `DISCARD_ALL` message, the server will dispose of all remaining items from the active result stream, close the stream and send a single `SUCCESS` message to the client.
If no result stream is currently active, the server will respond with a single `FAILURE` message.

If an unacknowledged failure is pending from a previous exchange, the server will immediately respond with a single `IGNORED` message and take no further action.

.Response
- `SUCCESS {}` if the result stream has been successfully discarded
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if no result stream is currently available

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: DISCARD_ALL

B0 2F
----

==== PULL_ALL

The `PULL_ALL` message is a client message used to retrieve all remaining items from the active result stream.
It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
PullAllMessage (signature=0x3F) {
}
----

On receipt of a `PULL_ALL` message, the server will send all remaining result data items to the client, each in a single `RECORD` message.
The server will then close the stream and send a single `SUCCESS` message optionally containing summary information on the data items sent.
If an error is encountered, the server must instead send a `FAILURE` message, discard all remaining data items and close the stream.

If an unacknowledged failure is pending from a previous exchange, the server will immediately respond with a single `IGNORED` message and take no further action.

.Response
- `SUCCESS {...}` if the result stream has been successfully transferred
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if no result stream is currently available or if retrieval fails

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: PULL_ALL

B0 3F
----

[[bolt-message-structs-reset]]
==== RESET

The `RESET` message is a client message used to return the current session to a "clean" state.
It will cause the session to `IGNORE` any message it is currently processing, as well as any message before `RESET` that had not yet begun processing.
This allows `RESET` to abort long-running operations.
It also means clients must be careful about pipelining `RESET`.
Only send this if you are not currently waiting for a result from a prior message, or if you want to explicitly abort any prior message.

The following actions are performed by `RESET`:

- force any currently processing message to abort with `IGNORE`
- force any pending messages that have not yet started processing to be `IGNORED`
- clear any outstanding `FAILURE` state
- dispose of any outstanding result records
- rollback the current transaction (if any)

See <<bolt-examples-reset>> for example usage.

Also, see <<bolt-message-structs-ack-failure>> for a message that only clears `FAILURE` state


[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
ResetMessage (signature=0x0F) {
}
----

.Response
- `SUCCESS {}` if the session was successfully reset
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if a reset is not currently possible

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: RESET

B0 0F
----

[[bolt-message-structs-ack-failure]]
==== ACK_FAILURE

The `ACK_FAILURE` message is a client message used to acknowledge a failure the server has sent.
It is similar to `RESET`, but it does not roll back open transactions, nor does it interrupt running operations.

This can be a better option than `RESET` in cases where a client wants to explicitly call "ROLLBACK" in case of failure.
A good example of this is in a shell environment, where an error should cause all subsequent statements to fail until the transaction is rolled back.

The following actions are performed by `ACK_FAILURE`:

- clear any outstanding `FAILURE` state
- dispose of any outstanding result records

See <<bolt-examples-ack-failure>> for an example.

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
AckFailureMessage (signature=0x0E) {
}
----

.Response
- `SUCCESS {}` if the session was successfully reset
- `FAILURE {"code": ..., "message": ...}` if a reset is not currently possible

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: ACK_FAILURE

B0 0E
----

==== RECORD

The `RECORD` message is a server detail message used to deliver data from the server to the client.
Each record message contains a single List, which in turn contains the fields of the record in order.
It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
RecordMessage (signature=0x71) {
    List<Value> fields
}
----

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: RECORD [1,2,3]

B1 71 93 01  02 03
----

==== SUCCESS

The `SUCCESS` message is a server summary message used to signal that a corresponding client message has been received and actioned as intended.
The message contains a map of metadata, the contents of which depend on the original request.
It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
SuccessMessage (signature=0x70) {
    Map<String,Value> metadata
}
----

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: SUCCESS { "fields": ["name", "age"]}

B1 70 A1 86  66 69 65 6C  64 73 92 84  6E 61 6D 65
83 61 67 65
----

==== FAILURE

The `FAILURE` message is a server summary message used to signal that a corresponding client message has encountered an error while being processed.
It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
FailureMessage (signature=0x7F) {
    Map<String,Value> metadata
}
----

`FAILURE` messages contain metadata providing details regarding the primary failure that has occurred.
This metadata is a simple map containing a code and a message. These codes map to the standard Neo4j status codes.

When a `FAILURE` occurs, in most cases any open transaction will be rolled back.
However, if the `FAILURE` is classified as a `client error`, the transaction will be left open and can be used again
after the `FAILURE` has been acknowledged.
This is mainly to support user-driven queries, where a database administrator may have built up a large transaction, and
we do not want a simple spelling mistake to roll it all back.

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: FAILURE { "code": "Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError", "message": "Invalid syntax." }

B1 7F A2 84  63 6F 64 65  D0 25 4E 65  6F 2E 43 6C
69 65 6E 74  45 72 72 6F  72 2E 53 74  61 74 65 6D
65 6E 74 2E  53 79 6E 74  61 78 45 72  72 6F 72 87
6D 65 73 73  61 67 65 8F  49 6E 76 61  6C 69 64 20
73 79 6E 74  61 78 2E
----

==== IGNORED

The `IGNORED` message is a server summary message used to signal that a corresponding client message has been ignored and not actioned.
It has the following structure:

[source,bolt_message_struct]
----
IgnoredMessage (signature=0x7E) {
    Map<String,Value>  metadata
}
----

A client message will be ignored if an earlier failure has not yet been acknowledged by the client via a `RESET` message.
For example, this will occur if the client optimistically sends a group of messages, one of which fails during execution: all subsequent messages in that group will then be ignored.
Note that the original `PULL_ALL` message was never processed by the server.

.Example
[source,bolt_packstream_type]
----
Value: IGNORED
