classes in the lib/ directory.

The scripts and related source code are:

  * embedded-neo4j                org.neo4j.examples.EmbeddedNeo4j 
  * embedded-neo4j-with-indexing  org.neo4j.examples.EmbeddedNeo4jWithIndexing 
  * calculate-shortest-path       org.neo4j.examples.CalculateShortestPath
  * using-integrated-index        org.neo4j.examples.UsingIntegratedIndex
  * shell-example                 org.neo4j.examples.Neo4jShell
