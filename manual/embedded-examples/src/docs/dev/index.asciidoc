= Using Neo4j embedded in Java applications

It's easy to use Neo4j embedded in Java applications.
In this chapter you will find everything needed -- from setting up the environment to doing something useful with your data.

[WARNING]
====
When running your own code alongside Neo4j in the same JVM, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

* Don't create or retain more objects than you strictly need to.
  Large caches are particularly good at promoting many objects to the old generation, thus increasing the need for expensive full garbage collections.
* Don't use internal Neo4j APIs.
  They may change in future releases, and they might not always work as intended in the context of your code.
* Don't enable the `-XX:+TrustFinalNonStaticFields` JVM flag when running in embedded mode.
