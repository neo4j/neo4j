Calculating the shortest path (least number of relationships) between two nodes:

Using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm[Dijkstra's algorithm] to calculate cheapest path between node A and B where each relationship can have a weight (i.e. cost) and the path(s) with least cost are found.

Using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm[A*] to calculate the cheapest path between node A and B, where cheapest is for example the path in a network of roads which has the shortest length between node A and B.
Here's our example graph:
