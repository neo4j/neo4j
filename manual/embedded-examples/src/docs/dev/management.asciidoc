Reading a management attribute
==============================

The link:javadocs/org/neo4j/jmx/JmxUtils.html[JmxUtils]
class includes methods to access Neo4j management beans.
The common JMX service can be used as well, but from your code you probably rather
want to use the approach outlined here.

[TIP]
The source code of the example is found here:
https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/{neo4j-git-tag}/community/embedded-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/examples/JmxDocTest.java[JmxDocTest.java]

This example shows how to get the start time of a database:
	
[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-examples
source=org/neo4j/examples/JmxDocTest.java
tag=getStartTime
----

Depending on which Neo4j edition you are using different sets of management beans are available.

* For all editions, see the link:javadocs/org/neo4j/jmx/package-summary.html[org.neo4j.jmx] package.
* For the Enterprise edition, see the link:javadocs/org/neo4j/management/package-summary.html[org.neo4j.management] package as well.
