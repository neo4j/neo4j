== Nodes, Relationships, and Patterns

Neo4j's Property Graphs are composed of nodes and relationships, either of which may have properties (ie, attributes).
Nodes represent entities (eg, concepts, events, places, things);
relationships (which may be directed) connect pairs of nodes.

However, nodes and relationships are simply low-level building blocks.
The real strength of the Property Graph lies in its ability to encode _patterns_ of connected nodes and relationships.
A single node or relationship typically encodes very little information,
but a pattern of nodes and relationships can encode arbitrarily complex ideas.

Cypher, Neo4j's query language, is strongly based on patterns.
Specifically, patterns are used to match desired graph structures.
Once a matching structure has been found (or created), Neo4j can use it for further processing.

=== Simple and Complex Patterns

A simple pattern, which has only a single relationship, connects a pair of nodes (or, occasionally, a node to itself).
For example, _a Person_ `LIVES_IN` _a City_ or _a City is_ `PART_OF` _a Country_.

Complex patterns, using multiple relationships, can express arbitrarily complex concepts and support a variety of interesting use cases.
For example, we might want to match instances where _a Person_  `LIVES_IN` _a Country_.
The following Cypher code combines two simple patterns into a (mildly) complex pattern which performs this match:

[source,cypher]
----
(:Person) -[:LIVES_IN]-> (:City) -[:PART_OF]-> (:Country)
----

Pattern recognition is fundamental to the way that the brain works.
Consequently, humans are very good at working with patterns.
When patterns are presented visually (eg, in a diagram or map),
humans can use them to recognize, specify, and understand concepts.
As a pattern-based language, Cypher takes advantage of this capability.

== Cypher Concepts

Like {WP_SQL}[SQL] (used in {WP_RDBMS}[relational databases]),
Cypher is a textual, declarative query language.
It uses a form of {WP_AA}[ASCII art] to represent graph-related patterns.
SQL-like clauses and keywords (eg, `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `DELETE`) are used to combine these patterns and specify desired actions.

This combination tells Neo4j which patterns to match and what to do with the matching items (eg, nodes, relationships, paths, lists).
However, as a {WP_DP}[declarative] language, Cypher does _not_ tell Neo4j how to find nodes, traverse relationships, etc.
(This level of control is available from Neo4j's {WP_Java}[Java] {WP_API}[APIs], see <<server-unmanaged-extensions>>)

Diagrams made up of icons and arrows are commonly used to visualize graphs;
textual annotations provide labels, define properties, etc.
Cypher's ASCII-art syntax formalizes this approach, while adapting it to the limitations of text.

=== Node Syntax

Cypher uses a pair of parentheses (usually containing a text string) to represent a node, eg: `()`, `(foo)`.
This is reminiscent of a circle or a rectangle with rounded end caps.
Here are some ASCII-art encodings for example Neo4j nodes, providing varying types and amounts of detail:

[source,cypher]
----
()
(matrix)
(:Movie)
(matrix:Movie)
(matrix:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})
(matrix:Movie {title: 'The Matrix', released: 1997})
----

The simplest form, `()`, represents an anonymous, uncharacterized node.
If we want to refer to the node elsewhere, we can add a variable, eg: `(matrix)`.
Variables are restricted (ie, scoped) to a single statement:
a variable may have different (or no) meaning in another statement.

The `Movie` label (prefixed in use with a colon) declares the node's type.
This restricts the pattern, keeping it from matching (say) a structure with an `Actor` node in this position.
Neo4j's node indexes also use labels: each index is specific to the combination of a label and a property.

The node's properties (eg, `title`) are represented as a list of key/value pairs, enclosed within a pair of braces, eg: `{...}`.
Properties can be used to store information and/or restrict patterns.
For example, we could match nodes whose `title` is "The Matrix".

=== Relationship Syntax

Cypher uses a pair of dashes (`--`) to represent an undirected relationship.
Directed relationships have an arrowhead at one end (eg, `<--`, `-->`).
Bracketed expressions (eg: `[...]`) can be used to add details.
This may include variables, properties, and/or type information, eg:

[source,cypher]
----
-->
-[role]->
-[:ACTED_IN]->
-[role:ACTED_IN]->
-[role:ACTED_IN {roles: ['Neo']}]->
----

The syntax and semantics found within a relationship's bracket pair are very similar to those used between a node's parentheses.
A variable (eg, `role`) can be defined, to be used elsewhere in the statement.
The relationship's type (eg, `ACTED_IN`) is analogous to the node's label.
The properties (eg, `roles`) are entirely equivalent to node properties.
(Note that the value of a property may be an array.)

=== Pattern Syntax

Combining the syntax for nodes and relationships, we can express patterns.
The following could be a simple pattern (or fact) in this domain:

[source,cypher]
----
(keanu:Person:Actor {name: 'Keanu Reeves'} )
-[role:ACTED_IN     {roles: ['Neo']} ]->
(matrix:Movie       {title: 'The Matrix'} )
----

Like with node labels, the relationship type `ACTED_IN` is added as a symbol, prefixed with a colon: `:ACTED_IN`.
Variables (eg, `role`) can be used elsewhere in the statement to refer to the relationship.
Node and relationship properties use the same notation.
In this case, we used an array property for the `roles`, allowing multiple roles to be specified.

[NOTE]
.Pattern Nodes vs. Database Nodes
====
When a node is used in a pattern, it _describes_ zero or more nodes in the database.
Similarly, each pattern describes zero or more paths of nodes and relationships.
====

=== Pattern Variables

To increase modularity and reduce repetition, Cypher allows patterns to be assigned to variables.
This allow the matching paths to be inspected, used in other expressions, etc.

[source,cypher]
----
acted_in = (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
----

The `acted_in` variable would contain two nodes and the connecting relationship for each path that was found or created.
There are a number of functions to access details of a path, including `nodes(path)`, `rels(path)` (same as `relationships(path)`), and `length(path)`.

== Clauses

Cypher statements typically have multiple _clauses_, each of which performs a specific task, eg:

* create and match patterns in the graph
* filter, project, sort, or paginate results
* connect/compose partial statements

By combining Cypher clauses, we can compose more complex statements that express what we want to know or create.
Neo4j then figures out how to achieve the desired goal in an efficient manner.
