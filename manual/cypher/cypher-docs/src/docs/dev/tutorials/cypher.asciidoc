This chapter will guide you through your first steps with <<cypher-query-lang,Cypher>>.

In the online edition of this manual, all queries in this section can be executed interactively without installing Neo4j on your computer.

Otherwise, first get the Neo4j server running to try things out locally.
Instructions are found in <<server-installation>>.
With the server running, you can choose to issue Cypher queries from either the web interface or the Neo4j shell.
See <<tools-webadmin>> or <<shell>>.
