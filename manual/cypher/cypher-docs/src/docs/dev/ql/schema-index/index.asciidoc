= Indexes

A database index is a redundant copy of information in the database for the purpose of making retrieving said data more efficient.
This comes at the cost of additional storage space and slower writes, so deciding what to index and what not to index is an important and often non-trivial task.

Cypher allows the creation of indexes over a property for all nodes that have a given label.
Once an index has been created, it will automatically be managed and kept up to date by the database whenever the graph is changed.
Neo4j will automatically pick up and start using the index once it has been created and brought online.
