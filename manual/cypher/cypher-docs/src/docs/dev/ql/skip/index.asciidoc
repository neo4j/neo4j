= Skip

[abstract]
`SKIP` defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.

By using `SKIP`, the result set will get trimmed from the top.
Please note that no guarantees are made on the order of the result unless the query specifies the `ORDER BY` clause.
`SKIP` accepts any expression that evaluates to a positive integer -- however the expression cannot refer to nodes or relationships.
