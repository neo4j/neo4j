[[query-foreach]]
= Foreach =

[abstract]
The `FOREACH` clause is used to update data within a list, whether components of a path, or result of aggregation.

Lists and paths are key concepts in Cypher.
To use them for updating data, you can use the `FOREACH` construct.
It allows you to do updating commands on elements in a path, or a list created by aggregation.

The variable context inside of the foreach parenthesis is separate from the one outside it.
This means that if you `CREATE` a node variable inside of a `FOREACH`, you will _not_ be able to use it outside of the foreach statement, unless you match to find it.

Inside of the `FOREACH` parentheses, you can do any of the updating commands -- `CREATE`, `CREATE UNIQUE`, `MERGE`, `DELETE`, and `FOREACH`.

If you want to execute an additional `MATCH` for each element in a list then `UNWIND` (see <<query-unwind>>) would be a more appropriate command.
