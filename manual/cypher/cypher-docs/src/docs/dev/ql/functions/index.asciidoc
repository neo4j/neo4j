[[query-function]]
Functions
=========

This chapter contains information on all functions in Cypher.
Note that related information exists in <<query-operators>>.

NOTE: Most functions in Cypher will return `NULL` if an input parameter is `NULL`.

[[query-predicates]]
== Predicates ==

Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the `WHERE` part of a query.

See also <<query-operators-comparison>>.

[[query-functions-scalar]]
== Scalar functions ==

Scalar functions return a single value.

[IMPORTANT]
The `length()` and `size()` functions are quite similar, and so it is important to take note of the difference.
Due to backwards compatibility, `length()` currently works on four types: strings, paths, lists and pattern expressions.
However, for clarity it is recommended to only use `length()` on strings and paths, and use the new `size()` function on lists and pattern expressions.
`length()` on those types may be deprecated in future.

[[query-functions-list]]
== List functions ==

List functions return lists of things -- nodes in a path, and so on.

[[query-functions-string]]
== String functions ==

These functions all operate on string expressions only, and will return an error if used on any other values.
The exception to this rule is `toString()`, which also accepts numbers and booleans.
