[[query-function]]
Functions
=========

This chapter contains information on all functions in Cypher.
Note that related information exists in <<query-operators>>.

NOTE: Most functions in Cypher will return +NULL+ if an input parameter is +NULL+.

[[query-predicates]]
== Predicates ==

Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the +WHERE+ part of a query.

See also <<query-operators-comparison>>.

[[query-functions-scalar]]
== Scalar functions ==

Scalar functions return a single value.

[IMPORTANT]
The `LENGTH` and `SIZE` functions are quite similar, and so it is important to take note of the difference.
Due to backwards compatibility `LENGTH` currently works on four types: strings, paths, collections and pattern expressions.
However, for clarity it is recommended to only use `LENGTH` on strings and paths, and use the new `SIZE` function
on collections and pattern expressions. `LENGTH` on those types may be deprecated in future.

[[query-functions-collection]]
== Collection functions ==

Collection functions return collections of things -- nodes in a path, and so on.

[[query-functions-mathematical]]
== Mathematical functions ==

These functions all operate on numerical expressions only, and will return an error if used on any other values.

[[query-functions-string]]
== String functions ==

These functions all operate on string expressions only, and will return an error if used on any other values.
The exception to this rule is `TOSTRING()`, which also accepts numbers.

See also <<query-operators-string>>.

[NOTE]
The `STR()` function is deprecated from Neo4j version 2.3 and onwards.
This means it may be removed in a future Neo4j major release.
