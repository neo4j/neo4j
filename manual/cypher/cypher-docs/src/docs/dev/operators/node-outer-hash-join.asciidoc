= Node outer hash join =

Using a hash table, a node outer hash join joins the inputs coming from the left with the inputs coming from the right.
If inputs from the left do not have any matches coming from the right, nulls are produced for the identifiers from the right.
The join key is specific in the arguments of the operator.
