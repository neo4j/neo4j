= Variables

When you reference parts of a pattern or a query, you do so by naming them.
The names you give the different parts are called variables.

In this example:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)-->(b) RETURN b
----

The variables are `n` and `b`.

Variable names are case sensitive, and can contain underscores and alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), but must
always start with a letter.
If other characters are needed, you can quote the variable using backquote (+`+) signs.

The same rules apply to property names.

[IMPORTANT]
.Variables are only visible in the same query part
====
Variables are not carried over to subsequent queries.
If multiple query parts are chained together using `WITH`, variables have to be listed in the `WITH` clause to be carried over to the next part.
For more information see <<query-with>>.
