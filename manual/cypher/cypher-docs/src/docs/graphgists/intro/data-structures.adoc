= Utilizing Data Structures

//file:movies.csv
//file:roles.csv
//file:persons.csv
//file:movie_actor_roles.csv

Cypher can create and consume more complex data structures out of the box.
As already mentioned you can create literal lists (`[1,2,3]`) and maps (`{name: value}`) within a statement.

There are a number of functions that work with lists.
They range from simple ones like `size(list)` that returns the size of a list to `reduce`, which runs an expression against the elements and accumulates the results.

Let's first load a bit of data into the graph.
If you want more details on how the data is loaded, see <<cypher-intro-importing-csv>>.

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'movies.csv' AS line
CREATE (m:Movie {id: line.id, title: line.title, released: toInt(line.year)});
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'persons.csv' AS line
MERGE (a:Person {id:line.id}) ON CREATE SET a.name = line.name;
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'roles.csv' AS line
MATCH (m:Movie {id: line.movieId})
MATCH (a:Person {id: line.personId})
CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:[line.role]}]->(m);
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'movie_actor_roles.csv' AS line FIELDTERMINATOR ';'
MERGE (m:Movie {title: line.title}) ON CREATE SET m.released = toInt(line.released)
MERGE (a:Person {name: line.actor}) ON CREATE SET a.born = toInt(line.born)
MERGE (a)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:split(line.characters,',') }]->(m)
----

Now, let's try out data structures.

To begin with, collect the names of the actors per movie, and return two of them:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(actor:Person)
RETURN movie.title as movie, collect(actor.name)[0..2] as two_of_cast
----

//table

You can also access individual elements or slices of a list quickly with `list[1]` or `list[5..-5]`.
Other functions to access parts of a list are `head(list)`, `tail(list)` and `last(list)`.

== List Predicates

When using lists and arrays in comparisons you can use predicates like `value IN list` or `any(x IN list WHERE x = value)`.
There are list predicates to satisfy conditions for `all`, `any`, `none` and `single` elements.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Person)-->(:Movie)<--(:Person)
WHERE any(n in nodes(path) WHERE n.name = 'Michael Douglas')
RETURN extract(n IN nodes(path)| coalesce(n.name, n.title))
----

//table

== List Processing

Oftentimes you want to process lists to `filter`, aggregate (`reduce`) or transform (`extract`) their values.
Those transformations can be done within Cypher or in the calling code.
This kind of list-processing can reduce the amount of data handled and returned, so it might make sense to do it within the Cypher statement.

A simple, non-graph example would be:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH range(1,10) as numbers
WITH extract(n in numbers | n*n) as squares
WITH filter(n in squares WHERE n > 25) as large_squares
RETURN reduce( a = 0, n in large_squares | a + n ) as sum_large_squares
----

//table

In a graph-query you can filter or aggregate collected values instead or work on array properties.
// need to be rephrased somehow

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WITH m.title as movie, collect({name: a.name, roles: r.roles}) as cast
RETURN movie, filter(actor IN cast WHERE actor.name STARTS WITH 'M')
----

//table

== Unwind Lists

Sometimes you have collected information into a list, but want to use each element individually as a row.
For instance, you might want to further match patterns in the graph.
Or you passed in a list of values but now want to create or match a node or relationship for each element.
Then you can use the `UNWIND` clause to unroll a list into a sequence of rows again.

For instance, a query to find the top 3 co-actors and then follow their movies and again list the cast for each of those movies:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(colleague:Person)
WHERE actor.name < colleague.name
WITH actor, colleague, count(*) AS frequency, collect(movie) AS movies
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 3
UNWIND movies AS m
MATCH (m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a)
RETURN m.title AS movie, collect(a.name) AS cast
----

//table
