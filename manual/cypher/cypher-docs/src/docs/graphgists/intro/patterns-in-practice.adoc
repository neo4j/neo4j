= Patterns in Practice

== Creating Data

We'll start by looking into the clauses that allow us to create data.

To add data, we just use the patterns we already know.
By providing patterns we can specify what graph structures, labels and properties we would like to make part of our graph.

Obviously the simplest clause is called `CREATE`.
It will just go ahead and directly create the patterns that you specify.

For the patterns we've looked at so far this could look like the following:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'The Matrix', released: 1997})
----

If we execute this statement, Cypher returns the number of changes, in this case adding 1 node, 1 label and 2 properties.

//table

[source,querytest]
----
Nodes created: 1
Properties set: 2
Labels added: 1
----

As we started out with an empty database, we now have a database with a single node in it:

//graph

If case we also want to return the created data we can add a `RETURN` clause, which refers to the variable we've assigned to our pattern elements.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves', born: 1964})
RETURN p
----

This is what gets returned:

//table

If we want to create more than one element, we can separate the elements with commas or use multiple `CREATE` statements.

We can of course also create more complex structures, like an `ACTED_IN` relationship with information about the character, or `DIRECTED` ones for the director.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (a:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks', born: 1956})-[r:ACTED_IN {roles:['Forrest']}]->(m:Movie {title: 'Forrest Gump', released: 1994})
CREATE (d:Person {name: 'Robert Zemeckis', born: 1951})-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
RETURN a,d,r,m
----

This is the part of the graph we just updated:

//graph_result

In most cases, we want to connect new data to existing structures.
This requires that we know how to find existing patterns in our graph data, which we will look at next.

== Matching Patterns

Matching patterns is a task for the `MATCH` statement.
We pass the same kind of patterns we've used so far to `MATCH` to describe what we're looking for.
It is similar to _query by example_, only that our examples also include the structures.

NOTE: A `MATCH` statement will search for the patterns we specify and return _one row per successful pattern match_.

To find the data we've created so far, we can start looking for all nodes labeled with the `Movie` label.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)
RETURN m
----

Here's the result:

// graph_result

This should show both _The Matrix_ and _Forrest Gump_.

[source,querytest]
----
The Matrix
Forrest Gump
----

We can also look for a specific person, like _Keanu Reeves_.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
RETURN p
----

This query returns the matching node:

// graph_result

[source,querytest]
----
Keanu Reeves
1 row
----

Note that we only provide enough information to find the nodes, not all properties are required.
In most cases you have key-properties like SSN, ISBN, emails, logins, geolocation or product codes to look for.

We can also find more interesting connections, like for instance the movies titles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in and the roles he played.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN m.title, r.roles
----

// table

[source,querytest]
----
Forrest Gump
1 row
----

In this case we only returned the properties of the nodes and relationships that we were interested in.
You can access them everywhere via a dot notation `identifer.property`.

Of course this only lists his role as _Forrest_ in _Forrest Gump_ because that's all data that we've added.

Now we know enough to connect new nodes to existing ones and can combine `MATCH` and `CREATE` to attach structures to the graph.

== Attaching Structures

To extend the graph with new information, we first match the existing connection points and then attach the newly created nodes to them with relationships.
Adding _Cloud Atlas_ as a new movie for _Tom Hanks_ could be achieved like this:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
CREATE (m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas', released: '2012})
CREATE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN {roles:['Zachry']} ]->(m)
RETURN p,r,m
----

Here's what the structure looks like in the database:

// graph_result

[source,querytest]
----
1 row
Nodes created: 1
Relationships created: 1
Properties set: 3
Labels added: 1
----

TIP: It is important to remember that we can assign variables to both nodes and relationships and use them later on, no matter if they were created or matched.

It is possible to attach both node and relationship in a single `CREATE` clause.
For readability it helps to split them up though.

[IMPORTANT]
A tricky aspect of the combination of `MATCH` and `CREATE` is that we get _one row per matched pattern_.
This causes subsequent `CREATE` statements to be executed once for each row.
In many cases this is what you want.
If that's not intended, please move the `CREATE` statement before the `MATCH`, or change the cardinality of the query with means discussed later or use the _get or create_ semantics of the next clause: `MERGE`.

// not sure about the last sentence above

== Completing Patterns

Whenever we get data from external systems or are not sure if certain information already exists in the graph, we want to be able to express a repeatable (idempotent) update operation.
In Cypher `MERGE` has this function.
It acts like a combination of `MATCH` _or_ `CREATE`, which checks for the existence of data first before creating it.
With `MERGE` you define a pattern to be found or created.
Usually, as with `MATCH` you only want to include the key property to look for in your core pattern.
`MERGE` allows you to provide additional properties you want to set `ON CREATE`.

If we wouldn't know if our graph already contained _Cloud Atlas_ we could merge it in again.

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas'}) ON CREATE SET m.released = 2012
RETURN m
----

//table

We get a result in any both cases: either the data (potentially more than one row) that was already in the graph or a single, newly created `Movie` node.

[NOTE]
A `MERGE` clause without any previously assigned variables in it either matches the full pattern or creates the full pattern.
It never produces a partial mix of matching and creating within a pattern.
To achieve a partial match/create, make sure to use already defined variables for the parts that shouldn't be affected.

So foremost `MERGE` makes sure that you can't create duplicate information or structures, but it comes with the cost of needing to check for existing matches first.
Especially on large graphs it can be costly to scan a large set of labeled nodes for a certain property.
You can alleviate some of that by creating supporting indexes or constraints, which we'll discuss later.
But it's still not for free, so whenever you're sure to not create duplicate data use `CREATE` over `MERGE`.

[TIP]
`MERGE` can also assert that a relationship is only created once.
For that to work you _have to pass in_ both nodes from a previous pattern match.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title: 'Cloud Atlas'})
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m) ON CREATE SET r.roles = ['Zachry']
RETURN p,r,m
----

//graph_result

[source,querytest]
----
1 row
Tom Hanks
Zachry
Cloud Atlas
----

In case the direction of a relationship is arbitrary, you can leave off the arrowhead.
`MERGE` will then check for the relationship in either direction, and create a new directed relationship if no matching relationship was found.

If you choose to pass in only one node from a preceding clause, `MERGE` offers an interesting functionality.
It will then only match within the direct neighborhood of the provided node for the given pattern, and, if not found create it.
This can come in very handy for creating for example tree structures.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (y:Year {year: 2014})
MERGE (y)<-[:IN_YEAR]-(m10:Month {month: 10})
MERGE (y)<-[:IN_YEAR]-(m11:Month {month: 11})
RETURN y,m10,m11
----

This is the graph structure that gets created:

//graph_result

[source,querytest]
----
1 row
Nodes created: 3
Relationships created: 2
Properties set: 3
Labels added: 3
----

Here there is no global search for the two `Month` nodes; they are only searched for in the context of the _2014_ `Year` node.
