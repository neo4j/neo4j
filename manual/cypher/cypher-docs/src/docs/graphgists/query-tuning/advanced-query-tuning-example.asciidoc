= Advanced query tuning example

As with the basic query tuning example <<cypherdoc-basic-query-tuning-example>> we'll use a movies data set to demonstrate how to do more advanced query tuning.

//file:movies.csv
//file:actors.csv
//file:directors.csv

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "movies.csv" AS line
MERGE (m:Movie {title:line.title})
ON CREATE SET m.released = toInt(line.released), m.tagline = line.tagline
----

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'actors.csv' AS line
MATCH (m:Movie {title:line.title})
MERGE (p:Person {name:line.name})
ON CREATE SET p.born = toInt(line.born)
MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:split(line.roles,";")}]->(m)
----

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'directors.csv' AS line
MATCH (m:Movie {title:line.title})
MERGE (p:Person {name:line.name})
ON CREATE SET p.born = toInt(line.born)
MERGE (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
