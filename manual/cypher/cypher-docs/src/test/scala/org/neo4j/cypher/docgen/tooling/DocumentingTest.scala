/**
 * Base class for documentation classes
 *
 * When working with the documentation framework, it helps having the modeling
 * idea clear before trying to understand the code.
 *
 * The model used here is that these tests describe a tree structure that
 * contains both queries to be run and checked, and documentation in the same
 * class.
 *
 * Each DocumentingTest builds up one of these tree-structures, and this tree
 * is worked on in multiple steps, extracting queries and running them,
 * checking the results, and then inserting the results into the tree.
 *
 * Finally, if all the tests were successful, the results are written out to
 * disk as a single AsciiDoc file.
