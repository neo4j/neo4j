Lists
=====

Cypher has good support for lists.

== Lists in general ==

A literal list is created by using brackets and separating the elements in the list with commas.

###
RETURN [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] as list###

In our examples, we'll use the range function.
It gives you a list containing all numbers between given start and end numbers.
Range is inclusive in both ends.

To access individual elements in the list, we use the square brackets again.
This will extract from the start index and up to but not including the end index.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[3]###

You can also use negative numbers, to start from the end of the list instead.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[-3]###

Finally, you can use ranges inside the brackets to return ranges of the list.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[0..3]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[0..-5]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[-5..]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[..4]###

NOTE: Out-of-bound slices are simply truncated, but out-of-bound single elements return +NULL+.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[15]###

###
RETURN range(0,10)[5..15]###

You can get the size of a list like this:

###
RETURN size(range(0,10)[0..3])###

== List comprehension ==

List comprehension is a syntactic construct available in Cypher for creating a list based on existing lists.
It follows the form of the mathematical set-builder notation (set comprehension) instead of the use of map
and filter functions.

###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 | x^3 ] AS result###

Either the +WHERE+ part, or the expression, can be omitted, if you only want to filter or map respectively.

###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 ] AS result###
###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) | x^3 ] AS result###


== Literal maps ==

From Cypher, you can also construct maps. Through REST you will get JSON objects; in Java they will be `java.util.Map<String,Object>`.

###
RETURN {key: "Value", listKey: [ {inner: "Map1"}, {inner: "Map2"} ] } AS result###
