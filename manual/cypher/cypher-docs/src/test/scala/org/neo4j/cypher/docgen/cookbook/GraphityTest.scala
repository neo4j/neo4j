In short, a linked list is created for every persons friends in the order that the last activities of these friends have occured.
When new activities occur for a friend, all the ordered friend lists that this friend is part of are reordered, transferring computing load to the time of new event updates instead of activity stream reads.

[TIP]
This approach of course makes excessive use of relationship types.
This needs to be taken into consideration when designing a production system with this approach.
See <<capabilities-capacity>> for the maximum number of relationship types.

To find the activity stream for a person, just follow the linked list of the friend list, and retrieve the needed amount of activities form the respective activity list of the friends.""",
