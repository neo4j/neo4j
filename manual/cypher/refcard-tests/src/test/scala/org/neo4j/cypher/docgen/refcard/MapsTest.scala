Literal maps are declared in curly braces much like property maps.
Nested maps and collections are supported.

###assertion=returns-one-merge parameters=map
//

MERGE (p:Person {name: {map}.name})

RETURN p
###

Maps can be passed in as parameters and used as map or by accessing keys.

###assertion=returns-one
//

MATCH (matchedNode:Person)
RETURN matchedNode

###

Nodes and relationships are returned as maps of their data.

###assertion=returns-one

map.name, map.age, map.children[0]

###

Map entries can be accessed by their keys.
Invalid keys result in an error.
