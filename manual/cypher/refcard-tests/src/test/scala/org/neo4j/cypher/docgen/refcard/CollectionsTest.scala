###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

["a", "b", "c"] AS coll

###

Literal collections are declared in square brackets.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=coll
RETURN

size({coll}) AS len, {coll}[0] AS value

###

Collections can be passed in as parameters.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=range
RETURN

range({firstNum}, {lastNum}, {step}) AS coll

###

Range creates a collection of numbers (+step+ is optional), other functions returning collections are:
+labels+, +nodes+, +relationships+, +rels+, +filter+, +extract+.

###assertion=returns-one
//

MATCH (a)-[r:KNOWS*]->()
RETURN r AS rels

###

Relationship identifiers of a variable length path contain a collection of relationships.

###assertion=returns-two
MATCH (matchedNode)

RETURN matchedNode.coll[0] AS value,
       size(matchedNode.coll) AS len

###

Properties can be arrays/collections of strings, numbers or booleans.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=subscript
WITH [1, 2, 3] AS coll
RETURN

coll[{idx}] AS value,
coll[{startIdx}..{endIdx}] AS slice

###

Collection elements can be accessed with +idx+ subscripts in square brackets.
Invalid indexes return +NULL+.
Slices can be retrieved with intervals from +start_idx+ to +end_idx+ each of which can be omitted or negative.
Out of range elements are ignored.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=names
//

UNWIND {names} AS name
MATCH (n {name: name})
RETURN avg(n.age)

###

With +UNWIND+, you can transform any collection back into individual rows.
The example matches all names from a list of names.
