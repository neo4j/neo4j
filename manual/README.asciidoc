= About Neo4j Manual =

The documents use the asciidoc format, see:

* http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/
* http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

== Building the documentation ==

Python is required, as well as graphviz.

http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] together with http://www.gnu.org/software/make/[Make] are used to unpack the pieces of the manual and to execute asciidoc on them.
Note that running parallel jobs with Make (-j option) is not supported.

To build the documentation, use: +
`mvn clean install` +
This will produce the manual (in 'target/docbkx/webhelp/').
Note that when inspecting the result using a `file://` URL the navigation tree won't load in Chrome.
If you need to see the tree, use a different browser or serve the files from a local webserver.

To build all dependencies of the manual, use the following at the top level of the repository: +
`mvn clean install -DdocsBuild` +

=== With brew on OSX ===
