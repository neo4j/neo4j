=== How it works ===

The main file for the content is '/manual/refcard/src/cypher-refcard.asciidoc'.
It loads include files created from executing tests against Neo4j.
That's done in the Scala project in the '/community/cypher/docs/refcard-tests' directory,
The tests are located in '/community/cypher/docs/refcard-tests/src/test/scala/org/neo4j/cypher/docgen/refcard'
