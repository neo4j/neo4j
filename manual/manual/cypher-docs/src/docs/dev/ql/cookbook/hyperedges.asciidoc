== Hyperedges ==

Imagine a user being part of different groups.
A group can have different roles, and a user can be part of different groups.
He also can have different roles in different groups apart from the membership.
The association of a User, a Group and a Role can be referred to as a _HyperEdge_.
However, it can be easily modeled in a property graph as a node that captures this n-ary relationship, as depicted below in the +U1G2R1+ node.
