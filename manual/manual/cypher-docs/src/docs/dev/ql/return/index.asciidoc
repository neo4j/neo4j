[[query-return]]
= Return

[abstract]
The `RETURN` clause defines what to include in the query result set.

In the `RETURN` part of your query, you define which parts of the pattern you are interested in.
It can be nodes, relationships, or properties on these.

[TIP]
If what you actually want is the value of a property, make sure to not return the full node/relationship.
This will improve performance.
