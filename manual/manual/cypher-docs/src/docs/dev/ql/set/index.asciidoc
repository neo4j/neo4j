[[query-set]]
= Set

[abstract]
The `SET` clause is used to update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.

+SET+ can also be used with maps from parameters to set properties.

[NOTE]
Setting labels on a node is an idempotent operations -- if you try to set a label on a node that already has that label on it, nothing happens.
The query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not.
