[[query-create-unique]]
= Create Unique

[abstract]
The `CREATE UNIQUE` clause is a mix of `MATCH` and `CREATE` -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing.

== Introduction ==

[TIP]
+<<query-merge,MERGE>>+ might be what you want to use instead of +CREATE UNIQUE+.
Note however, that +MERGE+ doesn't give as strong guarantees for relationships being unique.

+CREATE UNIQUE+ is in the middle of +MATCH+ and +CREATE+ -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing.
+CREATE UNIQUE+ will always make the least change possible to the graph -- if it can use parts of the existing graph, it will.

Another difference to +MATCH+ is that +CREATE UNIQUE+ assumes the pattern to be unique.
If multiple matching subgraphs are found an error will be generated.

[TIP]
In the +CREATE UNIQUE+ clause, patterns are used a lot.
