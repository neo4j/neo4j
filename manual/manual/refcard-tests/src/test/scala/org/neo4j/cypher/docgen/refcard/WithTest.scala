###assertion=friends parameters=name
//

###

The `WITH` syntax is similar to `RETURN`.
It separates query parts explicitly, allowing you to declare which identifiers to carry over to the next part.

###assertion=with-limit
//

MATCH (user)-[:FRIEND]-(friend)
WITH user, count(friend) AS friends
ORDER BY friends DESC
SKIP 1 LIMIT 3
RETURN user
###

You can also use `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT` with `WITH`.
