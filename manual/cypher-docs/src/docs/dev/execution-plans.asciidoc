= Execution Plans =

Cypher breaks down the work of executing a query into small pieces called operators.
Each operator is responsible for a small part of the overall query.
The operators are connected together in a pattern called a execution plan.

Each operator is annotated with statistics.

`Rows`::
The number of rows that the operator produced. Only available if the query was profiled.
`EstimatedRows`::
If Neo4j used the cost-based compiler you will see the estimated number of rows that will be produced by the operator.
The compiler uses this estimate to choose a suitable execution plan.
`DbHits`::
Each operator will ask the Neo4j storage engine to do work such as retrieving or updating data.
A _database hit_ is an abstract unit of this storage engine work.

See <<how-do-i-profile-a-query>> for how to view the execution plan for your query.

For a deeper understanding of how each operator works, see the relavent section.
Operators are grouped into high-level categories.
