[[query-delete]]
= Delete

[abstract]
The `DELETE` clause is used to delete graph elements -- nodes, relationships or paths.

For removing properties and labels, see <<query-remove>>.
Remember that you can not delete a node without also deleting relationships that start or end on said node.
Either explicitly delete the relationships, or use `DETACH DELETE`.

The examples start out with the following database:

include::includes/cypher-delete-graph.asciidoc[]

include::delete-single-node.asciidoc[]

include::delete-all-nodes-and-relationships.asciidoc[]

include::delete-a-node-with-all-its-relationships.asciidoc[]
