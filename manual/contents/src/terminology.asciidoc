= Terminology

The terminology used for <<term-cypher, Cypher>> and Neo4j is drawn from the worlds of database design and graph theory.
This section provides cross-linked summaries of common terms.

In some cases, multiple terms (e.g., arc, edge, relationship) may be used for the same or similar concept.
An asterisk (*) to the right of a term indicates that the term is commonly used for Neo4j and Cypher.

[glossary]
[[term-acyclic]]acyclic::
_for a graph or subgraph:_ when there is no way to start at some node `n` and  follow a sequence of adjacent relationships that eventually loops back to `n` again.
The opposite of <<term-cyclic,cyclic>>.

[[term-adjacent]]adjacent::
<<term-node, nodes>> sharing an <<term-incident, incident>>
(that is, directly-connected) <<term-relationship, relationship>>
or <<term-relationship, relationships>> sharing an incident node.

Synonym for <<term-property,property>>.

[[term-arc]]arc::
_graph theory:_ a synonym for a <<term-directed-relationship, directed relationship>>.

[[term-array]]array::
container that holds a number of elements.
The element types can be the types supported by the underlying graph storage layer, but all elements must be of the same type.

[[term-aggregating-expression]]aggregating expression::
expression that summarizes a set of values, like computing their sum or their maximum.

[[term-clause]]clause::
component of a <<term-cypher, Cypher>> <<term-query, query>> or <<term-command, command>>;

The following clauses currently exist in Cypher:
`CREATE`, `CREATE UNIQUE`, `DELETE`, `FOREACH`, `LOAD CSV`, `MATCH`, `MERGE`, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, `REMOVE`, `RETURN`, `SET`, `START`, `UNION`, and `WITH`.

[[term-co-incident]]co-incident::

This is internal to the execution of a given query.

[[term-label]]label::
marks a <<term-node, node>> as a member of a named subset.
A node may be assigned zero or more labels.
Labels are written as `:label` in <<term-cypher, Cypher>> (the actual label is prefixed by a colon).
Note: _graph theory:_
This differs from mathematical graphs, where a label applies uniquely to a single vertex.

[[term-loop]]loop::
a relationship that connects a node to itself.

[[term-neighbor]]neighbor::
_of node:_ another <<term-node, node>>, connected by a common <<term-relationship, relationship>>;
_of relationship:_ another relationship, connected to a common node.

[[term-node]]node*::
<<term-data-record, data record>> within a <<term-data-graph, data graph>>;
contains an arbitrary collection of <<term-property, properties>>.
Nodes may have zero, one, or more <<term-label, labels>>
and are optionally connected by <<term-relationship, relationships>>.
Similar to <<term-vertex, vertex>>.

[[term-null]]null::
`NULL` is a special marker, used to indicate that a data item does not exist in the <<term-graph, graph>> or that the value of an <<term-expression, expression>> is unknown or inapplicable.

[[term-operator]]operator::
there are three categories of operators in Cypher:
. _Arithmetic,_ such as `+`, `/`, `%` etc.;
. _Logical,_ such as `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` etc.; and
. _Comparison,_ such as `<`, `>`, `=` etc.

[[term-outgoing-relationship]]outgoing relationship::
_pertaining to a <<term-directed-relationship, directed relationship>>:_
from the point of view of a <<term-node, node>> `n`, this is any <<term-relationship, relationship>> `r` leaving `n`, exemplified by `(n)-[:r]->()`.
The opposite of <<term-incoming-relationship, incoming relationship>>.

[[term-pattern-graph]]pattern graph::
<<term-graph, graph>> used to express the shape (that is, connectivity pattern) of the data being searched for in the <<term-data-graph, data graph>>.
This is what `MATCH` and `WHERE` describe in a Cypher query.

[[term-path]]path*::
collection of alternating <<term-node, nodes>> and <<term-relationship, relationships>> that corresponds to a walk in the <<term-data-graph, data graph>>.

[[term-parameter]]parameter::

Parameters allow Cypher to efficiently re-use <<term-execution-plan, execution plans>> without having to parse and recompile every statement when only a literal value changes.

[[term-predicate]]predicate::
expression that returns `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NULL`.
When used in `WHERE`, `NULL` is treated as `FALSE`.

[[term-projection]]projection::
an operation taking <<term-result-row, result rows>> as both input and output data.
This may be a subset of the <<term-variable, variables>> provided in the input, a calculation based on variables in the input, or both.
The relevant <<term-clause, clauses>> are `WITH` and `RETURN`.

[[term-property]]property*::

Each <<term-node, node>> or relationship may have zero or more associated <<term-property, properties>>.

[[term-query]]query*::
statement that reads or writes data from the database

[[term-relationship]]relationship*::
<<term-data-record, data record>> in a <<term-property-graph, property graph>> that associates an ordered pair of <<term-node, nodes>>.
Similar to <<term-arc, arc>> and <<term-edge, edge>>.

[[term-relationship-type]]relationship type::
marks a relationship as a member of a named subset.
A relationship must be assigned one and only one type.
For example, in the <<term-cypher, Cypher>> pattern `(start)-[:TYPE]->(to)`,
`TYPE` is the relationship type.

[[term-result-row]]result row::
each <<term-query, query>> returns an iterator of result rows, which represents the result of executing the query.
Each result row is a set of key-value pairs (a record).

[[term-rollback]]rollback::
abort of the containing <<term-transaction, transaction>>, effectively undoing any changes defined inside the transaction.

[[term-schema]]schema::
persistent database state that describes available <<term-index, indexes>> and enabled <<term-constraint, constraints>> for the <<term-data-graph, data graph>>.

[[term-schema-command]]schema command::
<<term-statement, statement>> that updates the <<term-schema, schema>>.

[[term-statement]]statement::

or <<term-command, command>>.

[[term-type]]type::
types classify values.
Each value in <<term-cypher, Cypher>> has a concrete type.
Supported types are:
+
--
* string,
* boolean,
* the number types (double, integer, long),
* the map types (plain maps, nodes, and relationships),
* and collections of any concrete type.
--
+
The type hierarchy supports several other types (for example, any, scalar, derived map, collection).
These are used to classify values and <<term-collection, collections>> of values having different concrete types.

[[term-transaction]]transaction::
A transaction comprises a unit of work performed against a database.
It is treated in a coherent and reliable way, independent of other transactions.
A transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

[[term-transitive-closure]]transitive closure::
_of a graph:_ is a <<term-graph, graph>> which contains a <<term-relationship, relationship>> from <<term-node, node>> `x` to node `y` whenever there is a directed <<term-path, path>> from `x` to `y`;
For example, if there is a relationship from `a` to `b`, and another from `b` to `c`, then the transitive closure includes a relationship from `a` to `c`.

[[term-undirected-relationship]]undirected relationship::
a <<term-relationship, relationship>> that doesn't have a direction.
The opposite of <<term-directed-relationship,directed relationship>>.

[[term-vertex]]vertex::
_graph theory:_ the fundamental unit used to form a mathematical graph (plural: vertices).
See <<term-node,node>>.

////
[[term-cardinality]]cardinality::
this is the number of matching rows returned by a query or subquery.
The cardinality is used to estimate the <<term-selectivity,selectivity>>.

or <<term-node, nodes>> sharing a common <<term-label, label>>.

[[term-selectivity]]selectivity::
this is a measure (expressed as a ratio) of how many results are expected to be returned by a particular operation; the higher the selectivity, the more results are expected.
<<term-cardinality,Cardinality>> is used to estimate the selectivity.
