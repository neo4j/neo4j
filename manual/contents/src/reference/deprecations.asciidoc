= Deprecations =

This section outlines deprecations in Neo4j {neo4j-version} or earlier in order to help you find a smoother transition path to future releases.

Cypher ExecutionEngine::
There's no need to use `ExecutionEngine` any more:
instead, use the
link:javadocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/GraphDatabaseService.html#execute(java.lang.String)[execute]
methods on `GraphDatabaseService`.
`ExecutionEngine` and the related classes/interfaces have been deprecated, see the javadocs for details.

Embedded Java API::
See link:javadocs/deprecated-list.html[Deprecated list in Javadoc].

Graph Matching::
The graph-matching component will be removed in future releases.
