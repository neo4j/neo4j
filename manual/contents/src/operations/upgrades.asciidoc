This section describes upgrading a _single_ Neo4j instance.
To upgrade a _Neo4j HA cluster (Neo4j Enterprise)_, a very specific procedure must be followed.
Please see
ifndef::upgradetext[<<ha-upgrade-guide>>.]
ifdef::upgradetext['Upgrade of a Neo4j HA Cluster' at {manual-ha-upgrade-guide}.]

Throughout this instruction, the files used to store the Neo4j data are referred to as `database files`.
These files is are found in the directory specified by `dbms.directories.data` in `neo4j.conf`.

[CAUTION]
.Disk space requirements
====
An upgrade requires substantial free disk space, as it makes an entire copy of the database.
The upgraded database may also require larger data files overall.

It is recommended to make available an extra 50% disk space on top of the existing database files.

In addition to this, don't forget to reserve the disk space needed for the pre-upgrade backup.
====

[[supported-upgrade-paths]]
== Supported upgrade paths

Before upgrading to a new major or minor release, the database must first be upgraded to the latest version within the relevant release.
The latest version is available at this page: {neo4j-releases-download-page}.
The following Neo4j upgrade paths are supported:

* 2.0.latest -> {neo4j-version}

* 2.1.latest -> {neo4j-version}

* 2.2.latest -> {neo4j-version}

* 2.3.any -> {neo4j-version}

[[upgrade-instructions]]
== Upgrade instructions

. Cleanly shut down the database if it is running.
. Make a backup copy of the database files.
  If using the
ifndef::upgradetext[<<operations-backup, online backup tool>>]
ifdef::upgradetext[online backup tool (see http://neo4j.com/docs/{neo4j-version}/operations-backup.html)]
available with Neo4j Enterprise, ensure that backups have completed successfully.

. Install Neo4j {neo4j-version}.
. Review the settings in the configuration files in the previous installation, and transfer any custom settings to the {neo4j-version} installation. Since many settings have been changed between Neo4j 2.x and Neo4j 3.0, it is advisable to use the `2.x-config-migrator` to migrate the config files for you. The `2.x-config-migrator` can be found in the `tools` directory, and can be invoked with a command like: `java -jar 2.x-config-migrator.jar path/to/neo4j2.3 path/to/neo4j3.0`. Take note of any warnings printed, and manually review the edited config files produced.
. Import your data from the old installation using `neo4j-admin import --mode=database --database=<database-name> --from=<source-directory>` (for details, see `neo4j-admin help import`).
. If the database is not called `graph.db`, set `dbms.active_database` in `neo4j.conf` to the name of the database.
. Set `dbms.allow_format_migration=true` in `neo4j.conf` of the {neo4j-version} installation.
  Neo4j will fail to start without this configuration.
. Start up Neo4j {neo4j-version}.
. The database upgrade will take place during startup.
. Information about the upgrade and a progress indicator are logged into `debug.log`.
. When upgrade has finished, the `dbms.allow_format_migration` should be set to `false` or be removed.
. It is good practice to make a full backup immediately after the upgrade.

[NOTE]
.Cypher compatibility
====
The Cypher language may evolve between Neo4j versions.
For backward compatibility, Neo4j provides directives which allow explicitly selecting a previous Cypher language version.
This is possible to do globally or for individual statements, as described in the
link:{developer-manual-base-uri}/#cypher-compatibility[Neo4j Developer Manual -> Cypher Compatibility].
