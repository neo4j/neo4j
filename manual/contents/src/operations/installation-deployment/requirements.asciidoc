= System Requirements

Memory constrains graph size, disk I/O constrains read/write performance, as always.


== CPU

Performance is generally memory or I/O bound for large graphs, and compute bound for graphs that fit in memory.

Minimum::      Intel Core i3
Recommended::
+
Intel Core i7
+
IBM POWER8


== Memory

More memory allows even larger graphs, but needs to be configured properly to avoid larger garbage collection operations.
See <<performance-guide>> for suggestions.

Minimum::     2GB
Recommended:: 16--32GB or more


== Disk

Aside from capacity, the performance characteristics of the disk are the most important when selecting storage.
Neo4j workloads tend significantly toward random reads.
Prefer media with low average seek time: SSD over spinning disks.
Consult <<disks-ram-and-other-tips>> for more details.

Minimum::     10GB SATA
Recommended:: SSD w/ SATA


== Filesystem

For proper ACID behavior, the filesystem must support flush (_fsync_, _fdatasync_).
See <<linux-filesystem-tuning>> for a discussion on how to configure the filesystem in Linux for optimal performance.

Minimum::      ext4 (or similar)
Recommended::  ext4, ZFS


== Software

Neo4j requires a Java Virtual Machine to operate.
Community Edition installers for Windows and Mac include a JVM for convenience.
Other distributions, including all distributions of Neo4j Enterprise Edition, require that the JVM be provided.

Java::
+
http://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK 8] or http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle Java 8]
+
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/[IBM Java 8] (POWER8 only)
+
Operating Systems::
+
Linux, HP-UX, Windows Server 2012 for production
+
Additionally, Windows XP and Mac OS X for development
+
Architectures::
+
x86
+
OpenPOWER (POWER8, requires IBM Java or OpenJDK, version 8)

[IMPORTANT]
--
It is strongly recommended to use an up-to-date Java release as there are issues in early versions of Java 8 that are known to adversely affect Neo4j.
