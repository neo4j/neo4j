Monitoring
==========

NOTE: Most of the monitoring features are only available in the Advanced and Enterprise editions of Neo4j.

In order to be able to continuously get an overview of the health of a Neo4j database, there are different levels of monitoring facilities available. Most of these are exposed through the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html[JMX API].

=== Adjusting remote JMX access to the Neo4j Server ===

Per default, the Advanced and Enterprise Neo4j Server editions do not allow remove JMX connections, since the relevant options in the +conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf+ configuration file are commented out. To enable this feature, you have to remove the +#+ characters from the various +com.sun.management.jmxremote+ options there.

When commented in, the default values are set up to allow remote JMX connections with certain roles, refer to the +conf/jmx.password+, +conf/jmx.access+ and +conf/wrapper.conf+ for details.

Make sure that +conf/jmx.password+ has the correct file permissions. The owner of the file has to be the user that will run the service, and the permissions should be read only for that user. On Unix systems, this is 0600. 

On Windows, follow this tutorial to set the correct permissions. If you are running the service under the Local System Account, the user that owns the file and has access to it should be SYSTEM.

With this setup, you should be able to connect to JMX monitoring of the Neo4j server using +<IP-OF-SERVER>:3637+, with the username +monitor+ and the password +Neo4j+.

Note that it is possible that you have to update the permissions and/or ownership of the +conf/jmx.password+ and +conf/jmx.access+ files - refer to the relevant section in +conf/wrapper.conf+ for details

[WARNING]
For maximum security, please adjust at least the password settings in +conf/jmx.password+ for a production installation.

For more details, see: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html

=== How to connect to a Neo4j instance using JMX and JConsole ===

First, start your embedded database or the Neo4j Server, for instance using

[source,shell]
----
$NEO4j_SERVER_HOME/bin/neo4j start
----

Now, start JConsole with
[source,shell]
----
$JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole
----

Connect to the process running your Neo4j database instance:

Now, beside the MBeans exposed by the JVM, you will see an +org.neo4j+ section in the MBeans tab.
Under that, you will have access to all the monitoring information exposed by Neo4j.

For opening JMX to remote monitoring access, please refer to http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html#remote[the JMX documention]
and pass the +com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNum+ or other configuration as JVM parameters to your running Java process.

=== How to connect to the JMX monitoring programmatically ===

In order to programmatically connect to the Neo4j JMX server, there are some convenience methods in the Neo4j Management component to help you find out the most commonly used monitoring attributes of Neo4j.
For instance, the number of node IDs in use can be obtained with code like:

[source, java]
----
Neo4jManager manager = new Neo4jManager( graphDb.getManagementBean( Kernel.class ) );
long nodeIDsInUse    = manager.getPrimitivesBean.getNumberOfNodeIdsInUse();
----

Once you have access to this information, you can use it to for instance expose the values to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol[SNMP] or other monitoring systems.
