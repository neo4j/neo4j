1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
--------------------

- Kernel
o Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
  PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
o Added logging of recovery completion.
o Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
  the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
  lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

- Shell
o Fixed a problem where ShellServerExtension assumed the shell was enabled during shutdown, which could result in NPE.

- Lucene-index
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).
o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.
o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.

- HA
o When a new master is chosen, slaves throws away the id allocations they got from the previous master. This fixes a problem where occupied ids where reused.
o Enabled (and fixed problem with) thread on master which checks for dead slave connections and rolls back those transactions, so that their locks are released.
  This fixes a problem where an HA cluster would seem to freeze up and become unresponsive to write requests.
o Adding Log4j and Netty license information.
o Also closes the executor containing the connections.
o Changed dependency scopes.
o Shuts down databases after verifying them.

- Server
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now
o fixed duplicate paths for delete node or relationship from index
o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
o Added the ability extend the REST API with server plugins.
o Added back links to the first page in the HTML format.
o updating to Gremlin 0.6
o Updated the component site documentation with the new index API.
