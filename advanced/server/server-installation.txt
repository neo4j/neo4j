Server Installation
===================

Neo4j can be installed as a server, running either as a headless application or system service.

1. Download the latest release from http://neo4j.org/download
   * select the appropriate version for your platform
2. Extract the contents of the archive
   * refer to the top-level extracted directory as +NEO4J-HOME+
3. Use the scripts in the +bin+ directory
   * for Linux/MacOS, run `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j start`
   * for Windows, double-click on `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\Neo4j`
4. Refer to the packaged information in the +doc+ directory for details

== As a Windows service ==

With administrative rights, Neo4j can be installed as a Windows service.

1. Right-click on `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\InstallNeo4j`
2. Choose `Run as administrator`

To uninstall, run `UninstallNeo4j` as ad administrator.

== Linux Service ==

Neo4j can participate in the normal system startup and shutdown process.
The following procedure should work on most popular Linux distributions:

1. `cd $NEO4J_HOME`
2. `sudo ./bin/neo4j install`
   * if asked, enter your password to gain super-user privileges
3. `service neo4j-server status`
   * should indicate that the server is not running
4. `service neo4j-server start`
   * will start the server
   
   
== Multiple Server instances on one machine ==

Neo4j can be set up to run as several instances on one machine, providing for instance several databases for development. To configure, install two instances of the Neo4j Server in two different directories. Before running the Windows install or startup, change in conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf

[source, shell]
----
# Name of the service for the first instance
wrapper.name=neo4j_1
----

and for the second instance

[source, shell]
----
# Name of the service for the second instance
wrapper.name=neo4j_2
----

in order not to get name clashes installing and starting the instances as services. You might even need to adjust your unnix and linux startup scripts to properly start both instances.

Also, the port numbers for the web administration and the servers should be changed to non-clashing values in conf/neo4j-server.properties:

Server 1 (port 7474):

[source, shell]
----
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7474

org.neo4j.server.webadmin.data.uri=http://localhost:7474/db/data/

org.neo4j.server.webadmin.management.uri=http://localhost:7474/db/manage/
---

Server 2 (port 7475):

[source, shell]
----
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7475

org.neo4j.server.webadmin.data.uri=http://localhost:7475/db/data/

org.neo4j.server.webadmin.management.uri=http://localhost:7475/db/manage/
