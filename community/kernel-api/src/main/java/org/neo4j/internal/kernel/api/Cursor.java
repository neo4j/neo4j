/**
 * This interface is package-private because it is not generically useful. All use cases should use the explicit cursor
 * types. It is however useful to define this interface to ensure that the generic usage pattern (as outlined by the
 * example code snippet below) aligns across all cursor interfaces.
 * <p>
 * Generic usage:
 * <code><pre>
 * SomeCursor cursor = allocateCursorOfAppropriateType();
 * store.positionCursor( cursor );
 * while ( cursor.next() )
 * {
 *     do
 *     {
 *         // access data here ...
 *         // also make sure that data read here is considered valid until `shouldRetry()` is false.
 *     }
 *     while ( cursor.shouldRetry() );
 *     // use accessed data here ...
 * }
 * </pre></code>
