/**
 * A transaction with the graph database.
 *
 * Access to the graph is performed via sub-interfaces like {@link org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.Read}.
 * Changes made within a transaction are immediately visible to all operations within it, but are only
 * visible to other transactions after the successful commit of the transaction.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 * try ( Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction() )
 * {
 *      ...
 *      transaction.success();
 * }
 * catch ( SomeException e )
 * {
 *      ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Typical usage of failure if failure isn't controlled with exceptions:
 * <pre>
 * try ( Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction() )
 * {
 *      ...
 *      if ( ... some condition )
 *      {
 *          transaction.failure();
