 * As tests are packaged together with the API, they cannot provide all the functionality needed to construct the
 * test graph, or provide the concrete Kernel to test. These things are abstracted behind the
 * KernelAPIReadTestSupport interface, which needs to be implemented to test reading Kernel implementations.
 *
 * As read tests do not modify the graph, the test graph is created lazily on the first test run.
 *
 * @param <ReadSupport> The test support for the current test.
