/**
 * KernelAPIWriteTestBase is the basis of write tests targeting the Kernel API.
 *
 * Just as with KernelAPIReadTestBase, write tests cannot provide all the functionality needed to construct the
 * test kernel, and also do not know how to assert the effects of the writes. These things are abstracted behind the
 * KernelAPIWriteTestSupport interface, which needs to be implemented to test Kernel write implementations.
 *
 * Since write tests modify the graph, the test graph is recreated on every test run.
 *
 * @param <WriteSupport> The test support for the current test.
