= Import Tool

The import tool is used to create a new Neo4j database from data in CSV files.

This chapter will give the details on the format of the input data together with an example.

* Fields default to be comma separated, but a different delimiter can be specified.
* All files must use the same delimiter.
* Multiple data sources can be used for both nodes and relationships.
* A data source can optionally be provided using multiple files.
* A header which provides information on the data fields must be on the first row of each data source.
* Fields without corresponding information in the header will not be read.
* UTF-8 encoding is used.
* Indexes are not created during the import.
  Instead, add the indexes afterwards (see <<graphdb-neo4j-schema-indexes>>).

[NOTE]
Data cannot be imported into an existing database.
If that is what you want to do, see <<batchinsert>>.

[[import-too-header-format]]
== Header format

The header row of each data source specifies how the fields should be interpreted.
The same delimiter is used for the header row as for the rest of the data.

The header contains information for each field, with the format: `<name>:<field_type>`.
The `<name>` is used as the property key for values, and ignored in other cases.
The following `<field_type>` settings can be used for both nodes and relationships:

Property value:: Use one of `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `char`, `string` to designate the data type.
  If no data type is given, this defaults to `string`.
  To define an array type, append `[]` to the type.
  Array values are by default delimited by a `;`, but a different delimiter can be specified.
IGNORE::
  Ignore this field completely.

See below for the specifics of node and relationship data source headers.

[[import-too-header-format-nodes]]
=== Nodes

The following field types do additionally apply to node data sources:

ID::
  Each node must have a unique id which is used during the import.
  The ids are used to find the correct nodes when creating relationships.
  Note that the id has to be unique across all nodes in the import, even nodes with different labels.
LABEL::
  Read one or more labels from this field.
  For multiple labels, the values are separated by the array delimiter.

[[import-too-header-format-rels]]
=== Relationships

For relationship data sources, there's three mandatory fields:

TYPE::
  The relationship type to use for the relationship.
START_ID::
  The id of the start node of the relationship to create.
END_ID::
  The id of the end node of the relationship to create.

=== Basic Import Tool Example

Let's look at an example.
We'll use a tiny data set with movies, actors and roles.

First off, let's look at the movies.
Each movie has an id, which is used to refer to it in other data sources.
Then it always has a title and a year.
We also add labels to the nodes, in this case we use the labels `Movie` and `Sequel`.

.movies.csv
[source]
----
include::movies.csv[]
----

Next up are the actors.
They have an id, a name and all have the `Actor` label.

.actors.csv
[source]
----
include::actors.csv[]
----

Finally we have the roles, which are represented by relationships in the database.
Here we refer to the ids used in the other data sources, which happens in the `START_ID` and `END_ID` fields.
At the end of each row, we have put the relationship type to use.

.roles.csv
[source]
----
include::roles.csv[]
----

With all data in place, we execute the following command:

[source]
----
include::example-command.adoc[]
----

Now we're ready to start up a database from the target directory.
With the database running, we could add indexes.
See <<cypherdoc-labels-constraints-and-indexes>> for how to do that.

[[import-tool-separate-headers-example]]
=== Using Separate Header Files

It can be convenient to put the header in a separate file.
This makes it easier to edit the header, as you avoid having to open a huge data file to just change the header.

We'll use the same data as in the previous example, but put the headers in separate files.
This time the field delimiter character is altered, as well as the array-delimiter character and the quotation character.
See the command below for the details!
