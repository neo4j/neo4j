2.3.0-01
--------
o Added ability to skip duplicate nodes, i.e. multiple nodes with the same ID in the same id space.
  Maximum total number of bad entries (nodes and relationships) during an import is still controlled
  using --bad-tolerance=<max bad entries>. Skipping of bad relationships/nodes can be enabled/disabled
  individually with --skip-duplicate-nodes and --skip-bad-relationships.

2.2.2
-----
o Ability to skip duplicate nodes (nodes w/ duplicate input ids within the same id space).
  For this --skip-duplication-nodes as well as --skip-bad-relationships have been added.
  Number of bad entries to tolerate collectively is still controlled using --bad-tolerance
o Improved user feedback on common and import errors and user mistakes like forgetting to
  specify input files or leaving out mandatory header information etc. In some cases also
  points out a place in the manual for further information about a particular problem.
o Removes the --bad option which previously could specify the location and file name of
  the log containing bad input entries after an import. Now that log file will always be
  <into>/bad.log
o Input file names can now contain regular expressions and therefore match multiple files.
  Matching files will be correctly ordered according to any and all numbers found in their file names.

2.2.1
-----
o Ability to specify input encoding (using --input-encoding)
