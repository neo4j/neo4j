2.2.4
-----
o Fixes #4910 - TransactionData incorrect when modifying/deleting relationships.
o Read only transactions no longer trigger Transaction events
o Log rotation will now always leave at least one logical log in place regardless of prune strategy
  decisions. This ensures that there are always transactions to serve to slave and incremental backups
o Lifted the 63 name constraint per transaction for index commands. It is now possible to update more than 63 legacy
  indexes and/or 63 property names in a single transaction.
o Fixed a ClassCastException error that manifested under very specific conditions when updating a legacy index.
o Batch importer will now check all constraints when it shuts down and will report any violations

2.2.3
-----
o Fixes an issue where a shutdown of a database that had a panic might mark the database as cleanly shut down
  where it actually needed a recovery on next startup.
o Setting for specifying query logging `dbms.querylog.filename` now specifies a file, not a directory.
  This setting also now has no default, which means query logging is now disabled by default.
o Transaction event handlers can now reach relationship start/end node and type in afterCommit
  for created and deleted relationships without requiring a transaction.

2.2.2
-----
o Parallelized relationship import stage in the batch importer for better scalability
o Much better memory usage of :ID batch importer index, specifically around conflict resolutions.
o Properly propagates exceptions during startup of a database, regardless of whether or not shutdown throws exception.
o Much faster recovery after a non-clean shutdown or crash, due to transactions getting applied in batches.
o Fixes batch import issue with anonymous nodes, i.e. imported nodes w/o :ID. They could previously
  cause random failures during preparation of the IdMapper index.
o Reduced contention of updates to label scan store by using batching of concurrent transactions,
  similar to batched writes to the transaction log.
o Label scan store is built in parallel by the batch importer, to avoid waiting for it to build the first startup.
o Fixes an IdMapper encoding issue when using INTEGER id type which resulted in many unnecessary index conflicts,
  which in turn resulted in an unnecessarily high IdMapper memory consumption.

2.2.1
-----
o Fixed issue where counts could get not up to date values in db created with importer
o Importer doesn't set any empty array properties during import
o Fixed issue where importer could assign wrong sets of properties on relationships
  in the vicinity of "bad" relationships
o Fixed issue with AIOOBE during property encoding in importer
o Fixed race condition when taking a uniqueness constraint ONLINE which could let changes,
  that would violate the constraint, to be committed.
o Added ability to scan index in addition to scanning node store
o Fixed issue where importer IdMapper collision detection would use excessive memory
o Performance improvements to importer, specifically around preparing IdMapper

2.2.0

  reached during a commit

2.2.0-RC1

  logs (tm_tx_log.X) are no longer created
o Logical logs are now renamed to neostore.transaction.db.vXXX
o Introduces batched writes, which especially benefit small transactions
  and multi-threaded workloads
o Log rotation no longer transfers transactions in flight between
  logs, removing a class of performance issues
o Introduces count store (neostore.counts.db) for use by the
  cost based Cypher planner
o Deprecated Function and Function2 interfaces, as they are internal utility APIs.
  Users may still use the new org.neo4j.function.Function interface, but these are no
  longer considered official API. Users are expected to choose a utility library like
  Guava or apache commons for their utility needs.
o Extends the Transaction interface with a new method `terminate()` that makes it possible
  to mark the transaction as terminated, which means it will be both marked for rollback
  as well as all further operations carried out within that transaction will throw
  a `TransactionTerminatedException` exception.
o Adds an import script (neo4j-import on Unix, Neo4jImport on Windows) for bulk import
  of data from CSV files

2.1.8
-----
o Fixes an issue in the batch inserter, where writing multiple labels would not
  sort them correctly, and writing the same label twice could introduce
  duplicate label records.
o Fixes an issue where we would fail to delete the index files of a uniqueness
  constraint, if the database crashed during the commit of the transaction that
  created said constraint _and_ the constraint cannot be brought online because
  duplicates have since been committed.
o Fixes an issue where recovery of transactions that creates, drops and recreates
  an index, could leave it in a state where it wouldn't accept new writes.

-----
o It is now possible to define the amount of memory to dedicate to
  mapping portions of the relationship type storage
o Recovery of the relationship type store no longer leads to
  excessive size use because of improper id use

  will now result in an EntityNotFoundException
o Constraint enforcement is now more strict courtesy of using
  an up to date Lucene index reader

  shutting down
o Fixes potential ConcurrentModificationException from concurrent access to
  AutoIndexer configuration

2.1.5
-----
o Solves an issue where discrete remove+add operations on an existing property
  is not properly translated to a change operation, but rather is translated to
  an add operation
o Adds a property chain verification mechanism that detects duplicate property
  names for a given node/relationship as properties are loaded. It logs the
  state to the console, capped to 1 message every two hours
o Solves an issue where relationship removal from a node would lead to iteration
  over the relationships of that node to continue beyond the available relationship
  set
o Improves performance for index lookups during transactions by removing some
  exception handling
o Fixes issue with high id calculation that could lead to store file sizes being
  larger than required

  has many relationships in one direction, and none in the other direction.
o Fixes a memory leak in the object cache when the database was only creating
  new entities, i.e. when not reading or updating existing entities.
o Adds support for upgrading directly from 1.9 stores, in addition to the
  existing ability to upgrade from 2.0 stores.

2.1.2
-----

  during shutdown and no longer contain spans of zeroe'd
  records
o Solves issue with excessive number of Remove commands in
  the lucene logs, caused by having auto indexing enabled
  and changing properties
o Auto indexing no longer attempts to remove properties that
  have been removed from the configuration as candidates for

o Store upgrades will now migrate some transaction logs along with the
  store, allowing extraction of transactions without requiring
  new transactions to happen

  org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer#getPropertyKeys() and org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer#getProperty(String).
o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated methods from org.neo4j.kernel.GraphDatabaseAPI: #getDiagnosticsManager(),
  #getMessageLog(), #getIdGeneratorFactory(), #getKernelData() and #getPersistenceSource(). These are internal
  components which Kernel clients should not need to access. The entire org.neo4j.kernel.GraphDatabaseAPI interface is
  deprecated and will be removed in future.
o BREAKING CHANGE: Deprecated constructors of EmbeddedReadOnlyDatabase and EmbeddedGraphDatabase have been removed,
  in favor of the long-advertised alternative GraphDatabaseFactory.

  lazily instantiated builders
o BREAKING CHANGE: org.neo4j.graphdb.index.BatchInserterIndex and org.neo4j.graphdb.index.BatchInserterIndexProvider
  has been removed in favor of the same interfaces available in org.neo4j.unsafe.batchinsert
o BREAKING CHANGE: The BatchInserter and the BatchGraphDatabase are not binary compatible with 1.9 due to some methods

o Optimizations for read performance
  - Cache refers to relationship types as ints instead of Strings.
  - Binary search on sorted arrays for finding properties and
    relationship types in the cache.
  - Less objects instantiated during getting and iterating relationships.
  - Reduced number of map lookups significantly for a getProperty call,
    especially outside transaction or in transactions without any changes.
    (previously 8 lookups whereof 2 synchronized, now down to as low as 2)
  - Uses ThreadLocal as mapper from thread to transaction
  - Refactored LockReleaser into TransactionState, associated with each
    transaction instead

1.9.M01 (2012-10-23)
--------------------
o XaDatasources now implement lifecycle and their registration with XaDatasourceManager triggers TxManager recovery
  on startup
o Neo4j logical log now handles running out of disk space at a critical point gracefully.

  another thread doing this refresh, instead just continue knowing that the windows will be optimally
  placed in a very near future.
o Removed contention around translating a key (as String) into the ID by using copy-on-write map instead
  of a concurrent hash map. Used in property key as well as relationship type translation.
o Fix for Node/Relationship#getPropertyValues() sometimes returning null values from the iterator.
o Important log messages from the transaction manager and the persistence window pool are now logged
  to messages.log, rather than to java.util.logging.

1.8.M07 (2012-08-08)

  keep_logical_logs configuration is extended to support values such as: "10 days", "200M size" a.s.o.
  Regardless of configuration there will always be at least the latest non-empty logical log left.
o Loosened contention in PersistenceWindowPool#acquire a bit not requiring any synchronization on the pool level.

1.8.M04 (2012-06-07)
--------------------
o Additions to the traversal framework:
  + Bidirectional traversals (with BidirectionalTraversalDescription). AllPaths/AllSimplePaths
    uses this feature and are now faster due to less relationships being traversed.
  + Multiple start nodes (as well as multiple end nodes for bidirectional traversals).
  + PathExpander (RelationshipExpander for Paths) which has the full Path passed in instead of
    just the end node of the path. It can also see and modify a user defined traversal branch state.
  + Metadata about the traversal, for the time being: number of relationships traversal and
    number paths returned.
  + Added Path#reverseNodes() and Path#reverseRelationships which gives all nodes/relationships in
    a path in reverse order (starting from the end node going back to the start node). More relevant
	in many scenarios as well as allowing for a more efficient implementation.
  + Sorting of traversal results, specify with TraversalDescription#sort(Comparable).
  + Some measure to reduce memory consumption and garbage generation during traversals.

1.8.M03 (2012-05-24)

o Fixed a data race issue between threads removing the same property while the node is evicted from cache.
o Fixed an issue where a property record in the logical log was missing its owner.
o Added a checksum on a start record for a transaction combining Xid/master/me to get a pretty unique verification of equality.
o Log messages in messages.log are now printed in UTC time zone so that it's the same across servers.
o Fix for an issue where a full rebuild of an id generator (rebuild_idgenerators_fast=false) could result
  in exception when adding free ids.
o FileSystemAbstraction is in use everywhere instead of touch the FS directly.
o Fix for issue which would close an id generator as clean if a startup failed at the wrong time, which would make
  the id generator diverge from the store it held ids for and possible truncate that store file the next clean shutdown.

1.6 (2012-01-19)
----------------
o Minor performance optimization in property handling code.

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)

o Fixed an issue where sometimes dual start entries for a transaction would be added in the logical log.

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o Lower memory usage of ImpermanentGraphDatabase.
o Abstracted stores that stores id/name pairs into AbstractNameStore/AbstractNameRecord and removed lots of duplicated code.
o Fixed a race condition in the property cache which cuold poison the cache.
o Fixed an issue where a JVM crash in the wrong place would make the next startup rename the current logical log without
  incrementing the logVersion, making the next log rename fail.
o Start records in the logical log aren't written until the transaction starts preparing/committing. This fixes an issue
  with the logical log not being rotated sometimes.
o Added AbstractGraphDatabase#tx() which returns a TransactionBuilder possible of configuring the transaction to be "unforced"
  meaning that logical logs won't be forced when committing. Means better performance for small non-critical transactions.
o Reduced number of proxy object instantiation and node record loading in general.
o Added a wrapping graphdb abstraction, which makes instances survive even if the underlying db restarts.
o Detached LogExtractor from XaLogicaLog so that it can be used without having a db running.
o Added an API for progress indication. With a default implementation that prints dots (every 0.5%) and percentages
  (every 10%) to a PrintStream.
o Added Transaction#acquire{Read,Write}Lock for manually grabbing locks on nodes/relationships. Such locks can also be released earlier than tx.finish.

1.6.M01 (2011-11-24)
--------------------
o ImpermantentGraphDatabase now uses purely in-memory structures for speed during tests. It's done on a FileChannel level
  so that every other aspect of the database is intact, just that the bytes end up in ByteBuffers instead of files.
o Fixed an issue with evaluators not executing correctly for the start node of a traversal.
o Fixed an issue with BufferOverflowException thrown sometimes during extraction of prepared transactions.
o Added graph properties, i.e. properties that belongs to the graph itself as opposed to a specific node or relationship.
  Useful for extensions which would like to store configuration and what not.
o Better multi-line support in shell, as well as case insensitive app names.
o GraphDatabaseService#getAllNodes and #getRelationshipTypes @Deprecated and moved to GlobalGraphOperations class,
  where also #getAllRelationships is implemented.

1.5 (2011-10-18)
----------------
o Bug fixes for batch inserter and migration regarding new store format.
o Incremented log format version and added store version as a record in NeoStore for extra safety regarding migration.

1.5.M02 (2011-10-10)
--------------------
o Changes in 1.4.2
o [STORE FORMAT CHANGE] New layout of the property store(s) which results in roughly a 30% reduction in size on disk as well as fewer I/O read operations for reading properties.

1.4.2 (2011-09-27)
------------------
o Fixed bug where properties could temporarily disappear from cache if adding/removing properties on an entity in the same tx.
o Removed XaLogicalLog#getCommittedTransaction, which focused on extracting a single transaction and instead implemented getLogExtractor.
  It returns a LogExtractor which extracts transactions and keeps state after each extracted tx making it ideal to extract tx ranges.
  The implementation has got very limited and short-lived synchronization blocks.
o Fixed an issue where XaLogicalLog#applyCommittedTransaction didn't check log rotation.
o Fixed some issues with updating tx start position cache on log rotation.
o Keeping of logical logs is enabled if previous logs are discovered and configuration not explicitly disallowing it.
o Added DumpLogicalLog for index logs.
o Added an kernel panic event about TxManager set to "not OK" (and isn't able to begin any new transaction).

1.5.M01 (2011-08-31)
--------------------
o Changes in 1.4.1
o Auto indexing hooks in on each operation instead of transaction events.
o Fixed an issue where logical logs wouldn't be rotated if all transactions happened via applyPreparedTransaction (as in HA).
o Several recovery fixes which could produce an invalid state of the log files after a 2PC recovery.
o Loosened some synchronized regarding applying and getting committed transactions.
o Transaction semantics regarding call to success after failure was sync:ed with documentation.
o messages.log is rotated at 100Mb (configurable) and keeps at most three history files.
o Fixed bug where XaLogicalLog#applyTxWithoutTxId wouldn't force the logical log.
o Removed synchronization on TransactionImpl#toString() to avoid a deadlock issue.
o Fixed bug in StringLogger where it would stop logging to the underlying writer if an I/O error occurred or it was intermittently closed.

1.4.1 (2011-08-02)
------------------
o Improved file lock for an open database. Previously the file lock could be released after a full backup.
o Fixed a NPE exception during committing relationships to a NodeImpl representation.
o Fixed a data visibility issue for properties on newly created entities.

1.4.M05 (2011-06-22)
--------------------
o Improved performance for recovery and extract of transaction when running HA using buffered reads to log.
o Fixed bug that returned wrong representation of cached values for longs and ints.
o Fixed bug with spurious wakeups that could cause threads to receive interrupts by the kernel in wrong context.
o Fixed invalidation problem where there were more than one iterator loading a relationship chain lazily.
o Changed ordering of writes for records during commit to make sure other transactions can't read inconsistent state.
o Fixed performance bug when loading relationship chains that caused the arrays to be resized to many times.

1.4.M04 (2011-06-10)
--------------------
o Added the ability to auto index properties for database primitives
o Locks on database primitives acquired by neostore XAResources are now released during afterCompletion()
  of the global transaction. This allows for nodes and relationships to be used as monitors in distributed
  settings.

1.4.M03 (2011-05-26)
--------------------
o Kernel now supports self relationships or "loops".
o Added new relationship direction aware cache on nodes speeding up traversals by direction.
o Reduced memory usage by relationships.
o Reduced call stack removing the EventConsumer/ResourceConnection wrappers glue between nioneo and kernel.
o Fixed bug in global tx log that did not mark transactions finished when closed then crashed.
o Fixed cache invalidation when applying external transaction.

1.4.M02 (2011-05-12)
--------------------
o Changed the default implementation of the logical log to a DirectMappedLogBuffer.
o Changed the TxLog to use a DirectMappedLogBuffer instead of its ad hoc implementation.
o Added a configuration parameter (Config.USE_MEMORY_MAPPED_LOG) for controlling the log implementation (mmapped vs buffered)
  separately from the store files with a default value of 'false'.

1.3.M05 (2011-03-24)
--------------------
o Added support for HA and backup on Windows.
o Updated index API documentation.

1.3.M04 (2011-03-10)
--------------------
o A database can now contain 32 billion nodes/relationships and 64 billion properties.
o Fixed some issues with files not being closed, which also makes all tests pass on Windows.

--------------------
o Incremental and full backups can now be performed over the network (configurable port) using backup tool.
o Added optimized (compressed) storage for short strings.
o Refactored KernelExtension to make it easier to write implementations that follow the contract.
o Some refactorings and improvements around logging.

1.3.M02 (2011-02-10)
-----------------------
o Fixed a write performance bug in rotate of logical log.
o Modified persistence window allocation to be more optimistic when expanding a store file.

1.3-1.3 (2011-01-27)
--------------------

o Fix for a traverser issue where the first relationship could sometimes be skipped when choosing to traverse over relationships.
o Added SubProcess concept to ease development of tests which spawns other JVMs.
o More memory efficient extraction of transaction streams from logs.
o Better and safer upgrades from older index store formats.

1.2-1.2 (2010-12-29)
--------------------
o Made it possible to detect if recovery was performed as part of startup of the current instance.
o Fix for an issue that sometimes excluded the first relationship when iterating over the relationships of a traversal.

1.2-1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
------------------------
- Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
- Added logging of recovery completion.
- Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
- More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

1.2-1.2.M05 (2010-12-02)
------------------------

-API
o Added a BatchInserterIndex.setCacheCapacity(String key, int size) method
  which can be used to enable cache for certain keys for a batch inserter
  index so that lookups will be significantly faster.
o Traversal: Added Evaluator which is a merge between PruneEvaluator and
  filter (Predicate<Path> during traversal). This allows for more flexible
  evaluators and also more performant because a pruner/filter can be merged
  together where it has a full view of the decision making.

-Optimizations
o A memory leak was fixed, leading to decreased memory usage.

1.2-1.2.M04 (2010-11-18)
------------------------

o Added ImpermanentDatabase to aid in testing

o Better toString method

1.2-1.2.M03 (2010-11-04)
------------------------

o Monitoring/management over JMX was moved to the neo4j-management component.

-API
o Added ability to get the names of existing integrated indexes:
  o Index#getName() and Index#getConfiguration()
  o IndexManager#nodeIndexNames() and #relationshipIndexNames()
o Added utility to expand traversals using a relationship type in any direction:
  o Traversal.expanderForTypes(RelationshipType)

1.2-1.2.M02 (2010-10-21)
------------------------

o HA branch merged into trunk
o Made the "soft reference" cache type default.

-New features
o Added GraphDatabaseService#index() which exposes an integrated index framework.

-Optimizations
o Getting relationships requires less cache lookups and is therefore faster.

1.2-1.2.M01 (2010-10-08)
------------------------

-New features
o Kernel extensions - additional services for the Neo4j Kernel are loaded
  automatically if they are present on the classpath.
o The ability to inject Kernel extensions in a running instance through JVM
  agents. This is used for loading the shell on an running instance.

-API
o Traversal: Uniqueness is now instantiated through a factory, with
  the previous enum (moved to org.neo4j.kernel) as default implementation.
o Filters in a traversal description are additive (just as PruneEvaluators).

-Bug fixes
o Circumvented the fact that Class.forName() sometimes throws a
  NoClassDefFoundError instead of ClassNotFoundException.

-Optimizations
o NodeImpl/RelationshipImpl takes less memory since they no longer have
  reference to NodeManager.
o Fixed some low-level throughput/concurrency issues.
o Added (default) weak reference cache option. Control with f.ex. "cache_type=weak"

1.1 (2010-07-29)
----------------

-New features
o Auto configuration by looking at available RAM and heap.
o New event framework, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Event_framework
o JMX enabled kernel.
o New traversal framework, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Traversal_Framework
o Block size for strings and arrays are now configurable when creating a new db.
o Read only operations can now execute without a transaction.

-API
o Added a method to get the GraphDatabaseService on Node and Relationship.
o Moved the commons component utilities into kernel component,
  see helpers package.

-Bug fixes
o Fixed issues with logical log and active log that could cause recovery
  to throw an exception.
o Fixed buffer overflow for large string/array properties.
o Fixed bug that could cause leak of NodeImpl.


1.0 (2010-02-16)
----------------

-API
o Updated javadoc.

-Bug fixes
o Fixed leak of non committed property changes to other transactions.
o Fixed cache duplication bug of relationships.
o Fixed problem that could cause other exception to be thrown than
  NotFoundException on getNodeById/RelationshipById.
o Fixed problem with recovery when LuceneFulltextIndex entries existed
  in global transaction log.
o BatchInserter now throws exception when trying to create a relationship
  with same start and end node.
o Fixed problem with broken entries in logical log that could cause recovery
  to throw an exception.

1.0-rc (2010-01-10)
------------------

o API: moved API to org.neo4j.grapdb and implementation to
  org.neo4j.kernel.impl

1.0-b11 (2009-12-27)
--------------------

- Minor Enhancements, changes and tweaks
o Removed compile-time dependency on shell component.
o Batch inserter now has a NeoService version.
o Minor tweak of concurrency characteristics of array map implementation.

-Bug fixes
o Fixed problem with half entries in global tx log (due to full disk).
o Fixed some bugs in batch inserter.

1.0-b10 (2009-11-02)
--------------------

-Enhancements, new features and major changes
o Core: Read-only mode. It is now possible to start multiple read only
  NeoServices to the same store (using EmbeddedReadOnlyNeo).
o Core:  Improved depth first traversal speed on nodes with many
  relationships by loading relationships on demand. This will also
  reduce the stress on GC when traversing over a node with many
  relationships since much fewer objects will be created.

-Minor enhancements, changes and tweaks
o Core: Faster rebuild of id generators after a crash
o Core: Exception cleanup removing bad code either catching Throwable or
  throwing RuntimeException.
o Core: Fixed so a read only NeoService can apply a logical log from a
  backup.

-Bug Fixes
o Fixed a bug when using plain buffers instead of memory mapped ones that
  could case recovery to fail due to buffers not being flushed properly.


1.0-b9 (2009-08-14)
-------------------

-Enhancements
o Core: New 'batch insert' mode, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Batch_Insert,
  typically used for initial import of bulk data.
o Core: Added a "Windows mode" that uses plain Java buffers instead of mmap().
o Core: Expanded id space for all primitives by adding one more bit.
o Core: Read only transactions have been optimized to have much less overhead.
o Core: New cache implementation based on soft references, which employs faster
  gets and is more concurrent and memory efficient.
o Core: OSGi enabled [thanks Andreas Kollegger]

-Minor enhancements, changes and tweaks
o Shell: Added a traverser command for creating custom traversers.
o Shell: Added support of setting and listing array types.
o Shell: "cd" command can now position itself on a relationship.
o Shell: Output of "man" command has been improved.

-Bug fixes
o Core: Fixed all known batch inserter bugs.
o Core: Fixed a bug that could cause multiple remove of same property to fail
  (should just return null if it doesn't exist).


1.0-b8 (2009-05-03)
-------------------

-Enhancements, new features and major changes
o API: Added NeoService.getAllNodes for iterating across the entire node space
  and getRelationshipTypes() to get all reltypes in the underlying store.
o Core: Added logical log rotation and online-backup core features.
o Core: Reduced memory footprint and object allocation.
o Core: Moved all constraint checks to nioneo resulting in performance increase.
o Core: Improved traversal speed reworking set oriented caches to use arrays.

-Smaller enhancements, changes and tweaks
o API: Added a convenience implementation ofRelationshipType for dynamically
  created and named relationship types: DynamicRelationshipType.
o API: Deprecated PropertyContainer.getPropertyValues() to be removed in later
  releases.
o Core: Removed event manager dependency since it needs a rewrite (event
  generation still to be completely specified).
o Core: Transaction events have been removed, need proper specification.
o Core: Removed read lock on loading of non-cached node/relationship,
  replaced with reentrant lock stripe.
o Core: Persistence row windows in nioneo now only load data if acquired for
  read operation.
o Core: Upgraded to JTA 1.1
o Core: Improved some error messages.
o Core: EmbeddedNeo.toString now reports object id and neo store path.
o Core: Cleaned up logging messages during recovery.
o Core: Increased default block size for string and array stores to better
  fit avg. data sets out there.

-Bug fixes
o Core: Fixed missing close on TM's active log file.
o Core: A bug with copy on write "diff" maps that could cause wrong cached value
  to be read (for both properties and relationships) has been fixed.
o Core: Fixed an issue with non committed properties/relationships
  modifications leaking to other transactions (in cache layer during cache
  resize).
o Core: Fixed bug in property index manager that could cause created index
  not to be published at the right time.
o Core: Fixed bug that allowed for relationship/property loads on deleted
  node (in same tx).
o Core: Fixed some bugs caused by use of JTA tx synchronization hooks (we can't
  use them when ordering is required).
o Core: Fixed bug with relationship type store not handling "holes" correctly.
o Core: Fixed problem with multiple calls to close() on XaDataSources
o Core: Removed use IOException( Throwable ) since it is not in Java 1.5
o Core: Parsing of memory mapped settings can now handle G (1024*1024*1024).
o Core: Fixed silent catch of NotFoundException in traverser implementation.

-Notes
o Testing on Windows Vista platform has revealed a strange performance
  degradation for b8 that we've yet to find the cause of. The problem becomes
  more visible when running many concurrent transactions/threads hammering
  requests to Neo (10x performance decrease has been observed on same hardware).
  For production systems we recommend using GNU Linux or Solaris OS with Sun's
  1.6 JVM for best performance.


1.0-b7 (2008-09-29)
------------------

o API: Removed a number of deprecated methods (primarily for relationship type
  management) from EmbeddedNeo as per warning in the previous release.
o API: Transaction is now an interface.
o API: TraversalPosition now has an isStartNode() method.
o API: NotFound and NotInTransaction runtime exceptions have been moved from
  internal impl package to the api package.
o API: getRelationshipById is now exposed in NeoService.
o API: A common base interface for Node and Relationship has been added that
  contains the set/get/remove property operations.
o Core: Made it easy to embed Neo4j in a Spring application. Spring can also be
  configured to use Neo4j's transaction manager.
o Core: All known bugs have been fixed.
o Core: Removed singletons and made everything IoC.
o Core: Lots of minor optimization and improvements above native store
  layer (nioneo).
o Core: Cleanup of code (removed non used code) and improved exception handling.
o Core: Improved read performance and parallelism by implementing MVCC-like
  features. No locks are now taken during read-only operations, instead
  concurrent operations are working against snapshot versions. Rather than full
  versioning, for higher performance diffs are kept and applied to the right
  transactions (those that have modified data). Result is that read operations
  will execute taking no locks, make full use of what has already been cached
  and can execute concurrently with a transaction that modify the same data.
  Write operations will take locks and use diffs instead of full copy on write
  (this proved to be faster and scale better than actually doing a in memory
  copy of the required data).


1.0-b6 (2007-11-19)
-------------------

o API: Added a NeoService interface that EmbededNeo implements. Left a number
  of methods in EmbeddedNeo for backwards compatibility. They will be removed
  the next release.
o API: Changed relationship types to be dynamic, i.e. created in underlying
  store when they are first used. This means that clients won't have to
  register them with EmbeddedNeo at startup.
o API: The semantics of relationship type equivalence has changed from being
  based strictly on object identity to being based on name() equality.
o API: A a new method isType() has been added to Relatinship. Due to the less
  intuitive ways to check reltype equivalence, it's the prefered way to check
  whether a relationship is of a particular type.
o API: Added convenience methods hasRelationship(...) to Node.
o API: Added a convenience method notStartNode() to TraversalPositions to
  clean up the code (less cumbersome null-checks for edge cases) for evaluator
  implementations.
o Shell: Now detects and lists all available commands dynamically.
o Shell: Integration with Groovy for easy evaluation of Groovy scripts.
o Shell: Now auto-reconnects to server.
o Shell: Polish like cleaner output, filters to ls and bash-style prompt with
  variable expansion.
o Core: Lots of performance tweaks and improvements.
o Core: The internal version of the datastores have been changed. This release
  will transparently upgrade old versions of the store files so there's nothing
  manual involved. But after that, previous releases of Neo won't be able to
  read the store files.
o Core: Testing and robustification on Windows.
o Core: Now fully supports array properties for all primitives and Strings.
