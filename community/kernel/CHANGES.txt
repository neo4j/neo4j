o Fixed a data visibility issue for properties on newly created entities.
o Fixed a data visibility issue for relationships for nodes that didn't have the full relationship chain loaded.
o Fixed an issue where deleted relationships could be visible too long within the transaction deleting them.
o Auto indexing hooks in on each operation instead of transaction events.
o More relevant logging in messages.log.
o Fixed an issue where logical logs wouldn't be rotated if all transactions happened via applyPreparedTransaction (as in HA).
o Several recovery fixes which could produce an invalid state of the log files after a 2PC recovery.

1.4.M05 (2011-06-22)
--------------------
o Improved performance for recovery and extract of transaction when running HA using buffered reads to log.
o Fixed bug that returned wrong representation of cached values for longs and ints.

o Fixed invalidation problem where there were more than one iterator loading a relationship chain lazily.
o Changed ordering of writes for records during commit to make sure other transactions can't read inconsistent state.
o Fixed performance bug when loading relationship chains that caused the arrays to be resized to many times.

1.4.M04 (2011-06-10)
--------------------
o Added the ability to auto index properties for database primitives
o Locks on database primitives acquired by neostore XAResources are now released during afterCompletion()
  of the global transaction. This allows for nodes and relationships to be used as monitors in distributed
  settings. 

1.4.M03 (2011-05-26)
--------------------
o Kernel now supports self relationships or "loops".
o Added new relationship direction aware cache on nodes speeding up traversals by direction.
o Reduced memory usage by relationships.
o Reduced call stack removing the EventConsumer/ResourceConnection wrappers glue between nioneo and kernel.
o Fixed bug in global tx log that did not mark transactions finished when closed then crashed.
o Fixed cache invalidation when applying external transaction.

1.4.M02 (2011-05-12)
--------------------
o Changed the default implementation of the logical log to a DirectMappedLogBuffer.
o Changed the TxLog to use a DirectMappedLogBuffer instead of its ad hoc implementation.
o Added a configuration parameter (Config.USE_MEMORY_MAPPED_LOG) for controlling the log implementation (mmapped vs buffered)
  separately from the store files with a default value of 'false'.
  
1.3.M05 (2011-03-24)
--------------------
o Added support for HA and backup on Windows.
o Updated index API documentation.

1.3.M04 (2011-03-10)
--------------------
o A database can now contain 32 billion nodes/relationships and 64 billion properties.

--------------------
o Incremental and full backups can now be performed over the network (configurable port) using backup tool.
o Added optimized (compressed) storage for short strings.
o Refactored KernelExtension to make it easier to write implementations that follow the contract.
o Some refactorings and improvements around logging.

1.3.M02 (2011-02-10)
-----------------------
o Fixed a write performance bug in rotate of logical log.
o Modified persistence window allocation to be more optimistic when expanding a store file.

1.3-1.3 (2011-01-27)
--------------------

o Fix for a traverser issue where the first relationship could sometimes be skipped when choosing to traverse over relationships.
o Added SubProcess concept to ease development of tests which spawns other JVMs.
o More memory efficient extraction of transaction streams from logs.
o Better and safer upgrades from older index store formats.

1.2-1.2 (2010-12-29)
--------------------
o Made it possible to detect if recovery was performed as part of startup of the current instance.
o Fix for an issue that sometimes excluded the first relationship when iterating over the relationships of a traversal.

1.2-1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
------------------------
- Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
- Added logging of recovery completion.
- Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
- More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

1.2-1.2.M05 (2010-12-02)
------------------------

-API
o Added a BatchInserterIndex.setCacheCapacity(String key, int size) method
  which can be used to enable cache for certain keys for a batch inserter
  index so that lookups will be significantly faster.
o Traversal: Added Evaluator which is a merge between PruneEvaluator and
  filter (Predicate<Path> during traversal). This allows for more flexible
  evaluators and also more performant because a pruner/filter can be merged
  together where it has a full view of the decision making.

-Optimizations
o A memory leak was fixed, leading to decreased memory usage.

1.2-1.2.M04 (2010-11-18)
------------------------

o Added ImpermanentDatabase to aid in testing

o Better toString method

1.2-1.2.M03 (2010-11-04)
------------------------

o Monitoring/management over JMX was moved to the neo4j-management component.

  o Index#getName() and Index#getConfiguration()
  o IndexManager#nodeIndexNames() and #relationshipIndexNames()
o Added utility to expand traversals using a relationship type in any direction:
  o Traversal.expanderForTypes(RelationshipType)

1.2-1.2.M02 (2010-10-21)
------------------------

o HA branch merged into trunk
o Made the "soft reference" cache type default.

-New features
o Added GraphDatabaseService#index() which exposes an integrated index framework.

-Optimizations
o Getting relationships requires less cache lookups and is therefore faster.

1.2-1.2.M01 (2010-10-08)
------------------------

-New features
o Kernel extensions - additional services for the Neo4j Kernel are loaded
  automatically if they are present on the classpath.
o The ability to inject Kernel extensions in a running instance through JVM
  agents. This is used for loading the shell on an running instance.

-API
o Traversal: Uniqueness is now instantiated through a factory, with
  the previous enum (moved to org.neo4j.kernel) as default implementation.
o Filters in a traversal description are additive (just as PruneEvaluators).

-Bug fixes
o Circumvented the fact that Class.forName() sometimes throws a
  NoClassDefFoundError instead of ClassNotFoundException.

-Optimizations
o NodeImpl/RelationshipImpl takes less memory since they no longer have
  reference to NodeManager.
o Fixed some low-level throughput/concurrency issues.
o Added (default) weak reference cache option. Control with f.ex. "cache_type=weak"

1.1 (2010-07-29)
----------------

-New features
o Auto configuration by looking at available RAM and heap.
o New event framework, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Event_framework
o JMX enabled kernel.
o New traversal framework, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Traversal_Framework

o Fixed problem that could cause other exception to be thrown than 
  NotFoundException on getNodeById/RelationshipById.
o Fixed problem with recovery when LuceneFulltextIndex entries existed 
  in global transaction log.
o BatchInserter now throws exception when trying to create a relationship
  with same start and end node.

  to throw an exception.

1.0-rc (2010-01-10)
------------------

o API: moved API to org.neo4j.grapdb and implementation to 
  org.neo4j.kernel.impl

1.0-b11 (2009-12-27)
--------------------

- Minor Enhancements, changes and tweaks

o Fixed some bugs in batch inserter.

1.0-b10 (2009-11-02)
--------------------

-Enhancements, new features and major changes
o Core: Read-only mode. It is now possible to start multiple read only 
  NeoServices to the same store (using EmbeddedReadOnlyNeo).
o Core:  Improved depth first traversal speed on nodes with many 
  relationships by loading relationships on demand. This will also
  reduce the stress on GC when traversing over a node with many
  relationships since much fewer objects will be created.

-Minor enhancements, changes and tweaks
o Core: Faster rebuild of id generators after a crash
o Core: Exception cleanup removing bad code either catching Throwable or 
  throwing RuntimeException.
o Core: Fixed so a read only NeoService can apply a logical log from a 
  backup.

-Bug Fixes
o Fixed a bug when using plain buffers instead of memory mapped ones that 
  could case recovery to fail due to buffers not being flushed properly.


1.0-b9 (2009-08-14)
-------------------

-Enhancements
o Core: New 'batch insert' mode, see http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Batch_Insert,
  typically used for initial import of bulk data.
o Core: Added a "Windows mode" that uses plain Java buffers instead of mmap().
o Core: Expanded id space for all primitives by adding one more bit.
o Core: Read only transactions have been optimized to have much less overhead.
o Core: New cache implementation based on soft references, which employs faster
  gets and is more concurrent and memory efficient.
o Core: OSGi enabled [thanks Andreas Kollegger]

-Minor enhancements, changes and tweaks
o Shell: Added a traverser command for creating custom traversers.
o Shell: Added support of setting and listing array types.
o Shell: "cd" command can now position itself on a relationship.
o Shell: Output of "man" command has been improved.

-Bug fixes
o Core: Fixed all known batch inserter bugs.
o Core: Fixed a bug that could cause multiple remove of same property to fail
  (should just return null if it doesn't exist).


1.0-b8 (2009-05-03)
-------------------

-Enhancements, new features and major changes
o API: Added NeoService.getAllNodes for iterating across the entire node space
  and getRelationshipTypes() to get all reltypes in the underlying store.
o Core: Added logical log rotation and online-backup core features.
o Core: Reduced memory footprint and object allocation.
o Core: Moved all constraint checks to nioneo resulting in performance increase.
o Core: Improved traversal speed reworking set oriented caches to use arrays.

-Smaller enhancements, changes and tweaks
o API: Added a convenience implementation ofRelationshipType for dynamically
  created and named relationship types: DynamicRelationshipType.
o API: Deprecated PropertyContainer.getPropertyValues() to be removed in later
  releases.
o Core: Removed event manager dependency since it needs a rewrite (event
  generation still to be completely specified).
o Core: Transaction events have been removed, need proper specification.
o Core: Removed read lock on loading of non-cached node/relationship,
  replaced with reentrant lock stripe.
o Core: Persistence row windows in nioneo now only load data if acquired for 
  read operation.
o Core: Upgraded to JTA 1.1
o Core: Improved some error messages.
o Core: EmbeddedNeo.toString now reports object id and neo store path.
o Core: Cleaned up logging messages during recovery.
o Core: Increased default block size for string and array stores to better
  fit avg. data sets out there.

-Bug fixes
o Core: Fixed missing close on TM's active log file.
o Core: A bug with copy on write "diff" maps that could cause wrong cached value 
  to be read (for both properties and relationships) has been fixed.
o Core: Fixed an issue with non committed properties/relationships
  modifications leaking to other transactions (in cache layer during cache 
  resize).
o Core: Fixed bug in property index manager that could cause created index
  not to be published at the right time.
o Core: Fixed bug that allowed for relationship/property loads on deleted
  node (in same tx).
o Core: Fixed some bugs caused by use of JTA tx synchronization hooks (we can't 
  use them when ordering is required).
o Core: Fixed bug with relationship type store not handling "holes" correctly.
o Core: Fixed problem with multiple calls to close() on XaDataSources
o Core: Removed use IOException( Throwable ) since it is not in Java 1.5
o Core: Parsing of memory mapped settings can now handle G (1024*1024*1024).
o Core: Fixed silent catch of NotFoundException in traverser implementation.

-Notes
o Testing on Windows Vista platform has revealed a strange performance
  degradation for b8 that we've yet to find the cause of. The problem becomes
  more visible when running many concurrent transactions/threads hammering
  requests to Neo (10x performance decrease has been observed on same hardware).
  For production systems we recommend using GNU Linux or Solaris OS with Sun's
  1.6 JVM for best performance.


1.0-b7 (2008-09-29)
------------------

o API: Removed a number of deprecated methods (primarily for relationship type
  management) from EmbeddedNeo as per warning in the previous release.
o API: Transaction is now an interface.
o API: TraversalPosition now has an isStartNode() method.
o API: NotFound and NotInTransaction runtime exceptions have been moved from
  internal impl package to the api package.
o API: getRelationshipById is now exposed in NeoService.
o API: A common base interface for Node and Relationship has been added that
  contains the set/get/remove property operations.
o Core: Made it easy to embed Neo4j in a Spring application. Spring can also be 
  configured to use Neo4j's transaction manager.
o Core: All known bugs have been fixed.
o Core: Removed singletons and made everything IoC.
o Core: Lots of minor optimization and improvements above native store
  layer (nioneo).
o Core: Cleanup of code (removed non used code) and improved exception handling.
o Core: Improved read performance and parallelism by implementing MVCC-like 
  features. No locks are now taken during read-only operations, instead
  concurrent operations are working against snapshot versions. Rather than full
  versioning, for higher performance diffs are kept and applied to the right
  transactions (those that have modified data). Result is that read operations
  will execute taking no locks, make full use of what has already been cached
  and can execute concurrently with a transaction that modify the same data.
  Write operations will take locks and use diffs instead of full copy on write
  (this proved to be faster and scale better than actually doing a in memory
  copy of the required data).


1.0-b6 (2007-11-19)
-------------------

o API: Added a NeoService interface that EmbededNeo implements. Left a number
  of methods in EmbeddedNeo for backwards compatibility. They will be removed
  the next release.
o API: Changed relationship types to be dynamic, i.e. created in underlying
  store when they are first used. This means that clients won't have to
  register them with EmbeddedNeo at startup.
o API: The semantics of relationship type equivalence has changed from being
  based strictly on object identity to being based on name() equality.
o API: A a new method isType() has been added to Relatinship. Due to the less
  intuitive ways to check reltype equivalence, it's the prefered way to check
  whether a relationship is of a particular type.
o API: Added convenience methods hasRelationship(...) to Node.
o API: Added a convenience method notStartNode() to TraversalPositions to
  clean up the code (less cumbersome null-checks for edge cases) for evaluator
  implementations.
o Shell: Now detects and lists all available commands dynamically.
o Shell: Integration with Groovy for easy evaluation of Groovy scripts.
o Shell: Now auto-reconnects to server.
o Shell: Polish like cleaner output, filters to ls and bash-style prompt with
  variable expansion.
o Core: Lots of performance tweaks and improvements.
o Core: The internal version of the datastores have been changed. This release
  will transparently upgrade old versions of the store files so there's nothing
  manual involved. But after that, previous releases of Neo won't be able to
  read the store files.
o Core: Testing and robustification on Windows.
o Core: Now fully supports array properties for all primitives and Strings.
