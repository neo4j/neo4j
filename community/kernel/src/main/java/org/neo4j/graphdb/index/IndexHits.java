 * An {@link Iterator} with additional {@link #size()} and {@link #close()}
 * methods on it, used for iterating over index query results. It is first and
 * foremost an {@link Iterator}, but also an {@link Iterable} JUST so that it
 * can be used in a for-each loop. The <code>iterator()</code> method
 * <i>always</i> returns <code>this</code>.
 * 
 * The size is calculated before-hand so that calling it is always fast.
 * 
 * When you're done with the result and haven't reached the end of the
 * iteration {@link #close()} must be called. Results which are looped through
 * entirely closes automatically. Typical use:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * IndexHits<Node> hits = index.get( "key", "value" );
 * try
 * {
 *     for ( Node node : hits )
 *     {

 *     }

 * finally
