/**
 * A dynamically instantiated and named {@link RelationshipType}. This class is
 * a convenience implementation of <code>RelationshipType</code> that is
 * typically used when relationship types are created and named after a
 * condition that can only be detected at runtime.
 * <p>
 * If all relationship types are known at compile time, it's better to use the
 * relationship type enum idiom as outlined in {@link RelationshipType}.
 * <p>
 * It's very important to note that a relationship type is uniquely identified
 * by its name, not by any particular instance that implements this interface.
 * This means that the proper way to check if two relationship types are equal
 * is by invoking <code>equals()</code> on their {@link #name() names}, NOT by
 * using Java's identity operator (<code>==</code>) or <code>equals()</code> on
 * the relationship type instances. A consequence of this is that you can NOT
 * use relationship types in hashed collections such as
 * {@link java.util.HashMap HashMap} and {@link java.util.HashSet HashSet}.
 * <p>
 * However, you usually want to check whether a specific relationship
 * <i>instance</i> is of a certain type. That is best achieved with the
 * {@link Relationship#isType Relationship.isType} method, such as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * {@link RelationshipType} type = DynamicRelationshipType.{@link #withName(String) withName}( "myname" );
 * if ( rel.{@link Relationship#isType(RelationshipType) isType}( type ) )
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
