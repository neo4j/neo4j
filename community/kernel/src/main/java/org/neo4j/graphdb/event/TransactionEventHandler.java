/**
 * An event handler interface for Neo4j Transaction events. Once it has been
 * registered at a {@link GraphDatabaseService} instance it will receive events
 * about what has happened in each transaction which is about to be committed.
 * Handlers won't get notified about transactions which hasn't performed any
 * write operation or won't be committed (either if
 * {@link Transaction#success()} hasn't been called or the transaction has been
 * marked as failed, {@link Transaction#failure()}.
 * <p>
 * Right before a transaction is about to be committed the
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)} method is called with the entire diff
 * of modifications made in the transaction. At this point the transaction is
 * still running so changes can still be made. However there's no guarantee that
 * other handlers will see such changes since the order in which handlers are
 * executed is undefined. This method can also throw an exception and will, in
 * such a case, prevent the transaction from being committed.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)} is successfully executed the
 * transaction will be committed and the
 * {@link #afterCommit(TransactionData, Object)} method will be called with the
 * same transaction data as well as the object returned from
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)}. This assumes that all other handlers
 * (if more were registered) also executed
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)} successfully.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)} isn't executed successfully, but
 * instead throws an exception the transaction won't be committed and a
 * {@link TransactionFailureException} will (eventually) be thrown from
 * {@link Transaction#close()}. All handlers which at this point have had its
 * {@link #beforeCommit(TransactionData)} method executed successfully will
 * receive a call to {@link #afterRollback(TransactionData, Object)}.
