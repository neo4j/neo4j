/**
 * A label is a grouping facility for {@link Node} where all nodes having a label
 * are part of the same group. Labels on nodes are optional and any node can
 * have an arbitrary number of labels attached to it.
 *
 * Objects of classes implementing this interface can be used as label
 * representations in your code.
 *
 * It's very important to note that a label is uniquely identified
 * by its name, not by any particular instance that implements this interface.
 * This means that the proper way to check if two labels are equal
 * is by invoking <code>equals()</code> on their {@link #name() names}, NOT by
 * using Java's identity operator (<code>==</code>) or <code>equals()</code> on
 * the {@link Label} instances. A consequence of this is that you can NOT
 * use {@link Label} instances in hashed collections such as
 * {@link java.util.HashMap HashMap} and {@link java.util.HashSet HashSet}.
 * <p>
 * However, you usually want to check whether a specific node
 * <i>instance</i> has a certain label. That is best achieved with the
 * {@link Node#hasLabel(Label)} method.
 * 
 * For labels that your application know up front you should specify using an enum,
 * and since the name is accessed using the {@link #name()} method it fits nicely.
 * <code>
 * public enum MyLabels implements Label
 * {
 *     PERSON,
 *     RESTAURANT;
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * For labels that your application don't know up front you can make use of
 * {@link DynamicLabel#label(String)}, or your own implementation of this interface,
 * as it's just the name that matters.
 *
 * @see DynamicLabel
 * @see Node
