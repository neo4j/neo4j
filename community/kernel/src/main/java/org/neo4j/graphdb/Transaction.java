/**
 * A programmatically handled transaction.
 * <p>
 * <em>All database operations that access the graph, indexes, or the schema must be performed in a transaction.</em>
 * <p>
 * If you attempt to access the graph outside of a transaction, those operations will throw
 * {@link NotInTransactionException}.
 * <p>
 * Transactions are bound to the thread in which they were created. Transactions can either be handled
 * programmatically, through this interface, or by a container through the Java Transaction API (JTA). The
 * Transaction interface makes handling programmatic transactions easier than using JTA programmatically.
 * Here's the idiomatic use of programmatic transactions in Neo4j starting from java 7:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try ( Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx() )
 * {
 *     // operations on the graph
 *     // ...
 * 
 *     tx.success();
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Let's walk through this example line by line. First we retrieve a Transaction
 * object by invoking the {@link GraphDatabaseService#beginTx()} factory method.
 * This creates a new transaction which has internal state to keep
 * track of whether the current transaction is successful. Then we wrap all
 * operations that modify the graph in a try-finally block with the transaction
 * as resource. At the end of the block, we invoke the {@link #success() tx.success()}
 * method to indicate that the transaction is successful. As we exit the block,
 * the transaction will automatically be closed where {@link #close() tx.close()}
 * will be called and commit the transaction if the internal state indicates success
 * or else mark it for rollback.
 * <p>
 * If an exception is raised in the try-block, {@link #success()} will never be
 * invoked and the internal state of the transaction object will cause
 * {@link #close()} to roll back the transaction. This is very important:
 * unless {@link #success()} is invoked, the transaction will fail upon
 * {@link #close()}. A transaction can be explicitly marked for rollback by
 * invoking the {@link #failure()} method.
 * <p>
 * Read operations inside of a transaction will also read uncommitted data from
 * the same transaction.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Here's the idiomatic use of programmatic transactions in Neo4j on java 6 or earlier:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * Transaction tx = graphDb.beginTx();
 * try
 * {
 *     // operations on the graph
 *     // ...
 * 
 *     tx.success();
 * }
 * finally
 * {
 *     tx.close();
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * All {@link ResourceIterable ResourceIterables} that where returned from operations executed inside a transaction
 * will be automatically closed when the transaction is committed or rolled back.
 * Note however, that the {@link ResourceIterator} should be {@link ResourceIterator#close() closed} as soon as
 * possible if you don't intend to exhaust the iterator.
