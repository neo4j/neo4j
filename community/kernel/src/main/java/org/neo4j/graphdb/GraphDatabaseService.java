 * embed Neo4j in an application. Typically, you would create an

 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>GraphDatabaseService graphDb = new EmbeddedGraphDatabase( "var/graphDb" );
 * // ... use Neo4j
 * graphDb.{@link #shutdown() shutdown()};</code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * GraphDatabaseService provides operations to {@link #createNode() create
 * nodes}, {@link #getNodeById(long) get nodes given an id}, get the
 * {@link #getReferenceNode() reference node} and ultimately {@link #shutdown()
 * shutdown Neo4j}.
 * <p>
 * Please note that all operations that write to the graph must be invoked in a
 * {@link Transaction transactional context}. Failure to do so will result in a
 * {@link NotInTransactionException} being thrown.
