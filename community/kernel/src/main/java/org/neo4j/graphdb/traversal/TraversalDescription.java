/**

 * includes the new modification, leaving the instance which returns the new
 * instance intact. For instance,
 *
 * <pre>
 * TraversalDescription td = new TraversalDescriptionImpl();
 * td.depthFirst();
 * </pre>
 *
 * is not going to modify td. you will need to reassign td, like
 *
 * <pre>
 * td = td.depthFirst();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When all the rules and behaviors have been described the traversal is started
 * by using {@link #traverse(Node)} where a starting node is supplied. The
 * {@link Traverser} that is returned is then used to step through the graph,
 * and return the positions that matches the rules.
