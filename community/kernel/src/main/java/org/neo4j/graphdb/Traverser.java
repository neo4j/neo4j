/**
 * A traversal in the graph. A Traverser is an {@link Iterable} that
 * encapsulates a number of traversal parameters (defined at traverser creation)
 * and returns an iterator of nodes that match those parameters. It is created
 * by invoking {@link Node#traverse Node.traverse(...)}. Upon creation, the
 * traverser is positioned at the start node, but it doesn't actually start
 * traversing until its {@link #iterator() iterator().next()} method is invoked
 * and will then traverse lazily one step each time {@code next} is called.
 * <p>
 * When a Traverser is created it is parameterized with two evaluators and the
 * relationship types to traverse, with the direction to traverse each type in.
 * The evaluators are used for determining for each node in the set of candidate
 * nodes if it should be returned or not, and if the traversal should be pruned
 * (stopped) at this point. The nodes that are traversed by a Traverser are each
 * visited exactly once, meaning that the returned iterator of nodes will never
 * contain duplicate nodes. This also means that the traversed relationships
 * will form a spanning tree over the traversed nodes, with the side effect that
 * some internal relationships between nodes in the traversal are not traversed
 * (and hence not visible {@link TraversalPosition#lastRelationshipTraversed()
 * in the evaluators}).
 * <p>
 * Typically a Traverser is used in a for-each loop as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * Traverser friends = node.{@link Node#traverse(Traverser.Order, StopEvaluator, ReturnableEvaluator, RelationshipType, Direction) traverse}( {@link Order#BREADTH_FIRST Order.BREADTH_FIRST},
 *     {@link StopEvaluator#END_OF_GRAPH StopEvaluator.END_OF_GRAPH}, {@link ReturnableEvaluator#ALL_BUT_START_NODE ReturnableEvaluator.ALL_BUT_START_NODE},
 *     {@link RelationshipType MyRelationshipTypes.KNOWS}, {@link Direction#OUTGOING Direction.OUTGOING} );
 * for ( {@link Node Node} friend : friends )
 * {
 *     // ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Relationships are equally well traversed regardless of their direction,
 * performance-wise.
 *
 * @see Node#traverse
 * @deprecated because of an unnatural and too tight coupling with
 * {@link Node}. Also because of the introduction of a new traversal framework
 * and the usage of it. The new way of doing traversals is by creating a
 * new {@link TraversalDescription} from
 * {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService#traversalDescription()}, add rules and
 * behaviors to it and then calling
 * {@link TraversalDescription#traverse(Node...)}.

     * the traversal should go next than a depth first traversal does. Depth
     * first traversals are thus more memory efficient.
