     * Concurrent readers must also be able to parry for concurrent rotation.
     * Concurrent writes will not be an issue since rotation and writing contends on the same monitor.
     *
     * Steps during rotation are:
     * <ol>
     * <li>1: Increment log version, {@link LogVersionRepository#incrementAndGetVersion()} (also flushes the store)</li>

     * <li>3: Create new log file</li>
     * <li>4: Write header</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * Recovery: what happens if crash between:
     * <ol>
     * <li>1-2: New log version has been set, starting the writer will create the new log file idempotently.
     * At this point there may have been half-written transactions in the previous log version,
     * although they haven't been considered committed and so they will be truncated from log during recovery</li>
     * <li>2-3: New log version has been set, starting the writer will create the new log file idempotently.
     * At this point there may be complete transactions in the previous log version which may not have been
     * acknowledged to be committed back to the user, but will be considered committed anyway.</li>
     * <li>3-4: New log version has been set, starting the writer will see that the new file exists and
     * will be forgiving when trying to read the header of it, so that if it isn't complete a fresh
     * header will be set.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * Reading: what happens when rotation is between:
     * <ol>
     * <li>1-2: Reader bridge will see that there's a new version (when asking {@link LogVersionRepository}
     * and try to open it. The log file doesn't exist yet though. The bridge can parry for this by catching
     * {@link FileNotFoundException} and tell the reader that the stream has ended</li>
     * <li>2-3: Same as (1-2)</li>
     * <li>3-4: Here the new log file exists, but the header may not be fully written yet.
     * the reader will fail when trying to read the header since it's reading it strictly and bridge
     * catches that exception, treating it the same as if the file didn't exist.</li>
     * </ol>
     *

     * @return the channel of the newly opened/created log file.
