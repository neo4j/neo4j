/**
 * Main entry point into log entry versions and parsers and all that. A {@link LogEntryVersion} can be retrieved
 * by using {@link #byVersion(byte)} and from there get a hold of
 * {@link LogEntryParser} using {@link #entryParser(byte)}.
 *
 * Here follows an explanation how log entry versioning in Neo4j works:
 *
 * In Neo4j transactions are written to a log. Each transaction consists of one or more log entries. Log entries
 * can be of one or more types, such as denoting start of a transaction, commands and committing the transaction.
 * Neo4j supports writing the latest/current log entry and reading log entries for all currently supported versions
 * of Neo4j. The way versioning is done has changed over the years.
 *   First there was a format header of the entire log and it was assumed that all log entries within that log
 * was of the same format. This version actually specified command version, i.e. just versions of one of the
 * log entry types. This was a bit clunky and forced format specification to be passed in from outside,
 * based on the log that was read and so updated every time a new log was opened.
 *   Starting with Neo4j version 2.1 a one-byte log version field was introduced with every single log entry.
 * This allowed for more flexible reading and simpler code. Versions started with negative number to be able to
 * distinguish the new format from the non-versioned format. So observing the log entry type, which was the first
 * byte in each log entry being negative being negative was a signal for the new format and that the type actually
 * was the next byte. This to support rolling upgrades where two Neo4j versions in a cluster could be active
 * simultaneously, yet talking in terms of log entries of different versions.
 *
 * At this point in time there was the log entry version which signaled how an entry was to be read, but there
 * was still the log-global format version which didn't really do anything but make things complicated in the code.
 *   As of 2.2.4 the log-global format version is gone, although still just a token value written to adhere to
 * the 16 bytes header size of a log for backwards compatibility. The log entry version controls everything
 * about versioning of log entries and commands, such that if either log entry format (such as log entry types,
 * such as START, COMMIT and the likes, or data within them) change, or one or more command format change
 * the log entry version will be bumped.
 * The process of making an update to log entry or command format is to:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Copy {@link PhysicalLogCommandReaderV3_0_2} or similar and modify the new copy</li>
 * <li>Copy {@link LogEntryParsersV2_3} or similar and modify the new copy if entry layout has changed</li>
 * <li>Add an entry in this enum, like {@link #V3_0_10} pointing to the above new classes, version needs to be negative
 * to detect log files from older versions of neo4j</li>
 * <li>Modify {@link StorageCommand#serialize(WritableChannel)}.
 * Also {@link LogEntryWriter} (if log entry layout has changed) with required changes</li>
 * <li>Change {@link #CURRENT} to point to the newly created version</li>
 * </ol>
 * Everything apart from that should just work and Neo4j should automatically support the new version as well.
