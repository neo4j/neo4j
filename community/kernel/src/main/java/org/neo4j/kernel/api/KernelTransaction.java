/**
 * Represents a transaction of changes to the underlying graph.
 * Actual changes are made in the {@linkplain #acquireStatement() statements} acquired from this transaction.
 * Changes made within a transaction are visible to all operations within it.
 *
 * The reason for the separation between transactions and statements is isolation levels. While Neo4j is read-committed
 * isolation, a read can potentially involve multiple operations (think of a cypher statement). Within that read, or
 * statement if you will, the isolation level should be repeatable read, not read committed.
 *
 * Clearly separating between the concept of a transaction and the concept of a statement allows us to cater to this
 * type of isolation requirements.
 *
 * This class has a 1-1 relationship with{@link org.neo4j.kernel.impl.transaction.state.TransactionRecordState}, please see its'
 * javadoc for details.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 * try ( KernelTransaction transaction = kernel.newTransaction() )
 * {
 *      try ( Statement statement = transaction.acquireStatement() )
 *      {
 *          ...
 *      }
 *      ...
 *      transaction.success();
 * }
 * catch ( SomeException e )
 * {
 *      ...
 * }
 * catch ( SomeOtherExceptionException e )
 * {
 *      ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Typical usage of failure if failure isn't controlled with exceptions:
 * <pre>
 * try ( KernelTransaction transaction = kernel.newTransaction() )
 * {
 *      ...
 *      if ( ... some condition )
 *      {
 *          transaction.failure();
 *      }
 *
 *      transaction.success();
 * }
 * </pre>
