/**
 * The LockManager can lock resources for reading or writing. By doing this one
 * may achieve different transaction isolation levels. A resource can for now be
 * any object (but null).
 * <p>
 * Acquiring locks must be released after usage. Failure to do so will result in
 * the resource being blocked to all other transactions. Put all locks in a try -
 * finally block.
 * <p>
 * Multiple locks on the same resource held by the same transaction requires the
 * transaction to invoke the release lock method multiple times. If a tx has
 * invoked {@link #getReadLock(Object, Transaction)} on the same resource x times in
 * a row it must invoke {@link #releaseReadLock(Object, Transaction)} x times to release
 * all the locks. Same for write locks correspondingly.
 * <p>
 * LockManager just maps locks to resources and they do all the hard work
 * together with a {@link RagManager resource allocation graph}.
