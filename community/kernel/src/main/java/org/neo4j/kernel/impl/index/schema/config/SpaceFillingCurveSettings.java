 *     <dt>maxLevels<dt>

 *     <dt>extents</dt>
 *         <dd>The space filling curve is configured up front to cover a specific region of 2D (or 3D) space.
 * Any points outside this space will be mapped as if on the edges. This means that if these extents
 * do not match the real extents of the data being indexed, the index will be less efficient. Making
 * the extents too big means than only a small area is used causing more points to map to fewer 1D
