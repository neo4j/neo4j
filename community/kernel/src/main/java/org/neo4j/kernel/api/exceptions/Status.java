/**
 * This is the codification of all available surface-api status codes. If you are throwing an error to a user through
 * one of the key APIs, you should opt for using or adding an error code here.
 *
 * Each {@link Status} has an associated category, represented by the inner enums in this class.
 * Each {@link Status} also has an associated {@link Classification} which defines meta-data about the code, such
 * as if the error was caused by a user or the database (and later on if the code denotes an error or merely a warning).
 *
 * This class is not part of the public Neo4j API, and backwards compatibility for using it as a Java class is not
 * guaranteed. Instead, the automatically generated documentation derived from this class and available in the Neo4j
 * manual should be considered a user-level API.
 *
 * Currently, only the transactional http endpoint is dedicated to using these status codes.
