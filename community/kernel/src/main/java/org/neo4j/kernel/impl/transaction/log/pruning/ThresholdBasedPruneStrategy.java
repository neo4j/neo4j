         * To illustrate, imagine that there is a threshold in place configured so that it enforces prunning of the
         * log file that was just rotated out (for example, a file size threshold that is misconfigured to be smaller

         * transactions present on disk, making impossible to serve any to whichever client might ask, leading to
         * errors on both sides of the conversation.
         * This if statement does nothing more complicated than checking if the next-to-last log would be prunned
         * and simply skipping it if so.
