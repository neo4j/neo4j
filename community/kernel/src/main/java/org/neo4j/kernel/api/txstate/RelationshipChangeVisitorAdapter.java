/**
 * A visitor implementation that makes visiting changed relationships of a transaction easier by facilitating accessing

 * By invoking a constructor that takes a {@linkplain ReadableTxState transaction state} parameter, the default
 * implementation of {@link #visitAddedRelationship(long)} will retrieve the details of the visited relationship and
 * supply that information to the {@link #visitAddedRelationship(long, int, long, long)}-method. If no details can be
 * found, the transaction state is inconsistent with itself, and an exception will be thrown. If no such details are
 * required it is recommended to use one of the other constructors, and override {@link #visitAddedRelationship(long)}
