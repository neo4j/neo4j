/**
 * A command is part of the work done during a transaction towards a XA
 * resource. Any modifying operation invoked on a <CODE>XaResource</CODE> must
 * be in a transaction and wrapped in a <CODE>XaCommand</CODE>. Each command
 * created will be written to the {@link XaLogicalLog} once it is added to the
 * transaction.
 * <p>
 * Commands are memory buckets containing information on how to presist the
 * operation in the XA resource. Any nececcery constraint checks must take place
 * before any command has been executed. Once a command in the transaction has
 * started to execute there is no turning back, all of the following commands
 * must execute without problems. To ensure this check the constraints via a tx
 * synchronization hook, at prepare or upon command creation and signal the
 * transaction before it starts to commit if something is wrong.
 * <p>
 * Throwing exception when the command rollbacks or executes could (depending on
 * TransactionManager implementation) bring down the whole system. Should
 * however a <CODE>execute</CODE> or <CODE>rollback</CODE> call fail throw a
 * proper runtime exception.
 * <p>
 * Note that a command is during normal execution only executed once but it must
 * be able to execute again "re-writing" it self to underlying persistance store
 * during recovery. Think of the following scenario:
 * <p>
 * A transaction containing 50 commands begins to commit. When 24.5 commands
 * have been executed the system crashes. System is brought up again and the
 * transaction is recreated. The transaction manager tells the resource to
 * commit (again) and the 25 first commands will be executed for a second time
 * while the 25 last commands will be executed for the first time. Also it would
 * be possible for the system to crash during recovery causing commands to
 * execute again and again and so on.
