/**
 * This class generates unique ids for a resource type. For example, nodes in a
 * nodes space are connected to each other via relationships. On nodes and
 * relationship one can add properties. We have three different resource types
 * here (nodes, relationships and properties) where each resource needs a unique
 * id to be able to differ resources of the same type from each other. Creating
 * three id generators (one for each resource type ) will do the trick.
 * <p>
 * <CODE>IdGenerator</CODE> makes use of so called "defragged" ids. A
 * defragged id is an id that has been in use one or many times but the resource
 * that was using it doesn't exist anymore. This makes it possible to reuse the
 * id and that in turn makes it possible to write a resource store with fixed
 * records and size (you can calculate the position of a record by knowing the
 * id without using indexes or a translation table).
 * <p>
 * The id returned from {@link #nextId} may not be the lowest
 * available id but will be one of the defragged ids if such exist or the next
 * new free id that has never been used.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #freeId} will not check if the id passed in to it really is free.
 * Passing a non free id will corrupt the id generator and {@link #nextId}
 * method will eventually return that id.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #close()} method must always be invoked when done using an
 * generator (for this time). Failure to do will render the generator as
 * "sticky" and unusable next time you try to initialize a generator using the
 * same file. There can only be one id generator instance per id generator file.
 * <p>
 * In case of disk/file I/O failure an <CODE>IOException</CODE> is thrown.
