/**
 * A SchemaComputer computes values of type R from SchemaDescriptors. To get the concrete type of the target schema
 * descriptor, a visitor pattern is used to bounce the code path into the correct overloaded computeSpecific variant.
 * Perhaps the most useful way to view this, is to think of the computer as a switch on the argument .getClass, and
 * the computeSpecific as correctly typed cases. The benefit of using the visitor pattern, is that implementers of
 * new concrete SchemaDescriptor implementers will be forced to implement the necessary methods at compile time,
 * avoiding bugs due to missed instance of checks.
 *
 * DANGER: Visitor patterns can be very hard to follow and debug. Take care to make callers easily readable!
 *
 * @param <R> the computation result type
