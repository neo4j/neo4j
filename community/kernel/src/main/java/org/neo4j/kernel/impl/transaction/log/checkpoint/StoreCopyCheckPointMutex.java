/**
 * Mutex between {@link #storeCopy(ThrowingAction) store-copy} and {@link #checkPoint() check-point}.
 * This to prevent those two running concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Normally a store-copy implies first doing a check-point and so this relationships is somewhat intricate.
 * In addition to having {@link #storeCopy(ThrowingAction)} as the "read lock" and {@link #checkPoint()} as the
 * "write lock", {@link #storeCopy(ThrowingAction)} also accepts a code snippet to run before first concurrent
 * store-copy grabs the lock, a snippet which can include a check-point.
 *

 * |----------|-----|---------------|---|-----------|---------|-------------|------|--------------------------|-> TIME
 *            |     |                   |           |         |             |                                 |

 *            |     |                               |

 * </pre>
 *
 * In the image above there are three "events":
 * <ol>
 * <li>Store-copy 1, where there are three concurrent store-copies going on.
 * Only the first one performs check-point</li>
 * <li>External check-point, which waits for the ongoing store-copies to complete and then performs it</li>
 * <li>Store-copy 2, which waits for the external check-point to complete and then starts its own
 * check-point, which is part of the store-copy algorithm to then perform the store-copy.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Status changes are made in synchronized as opposed to atomic CAS operations, since this results
 * in simpler code and since this mutex is normally called a couple of times per hour it's not an issue.
