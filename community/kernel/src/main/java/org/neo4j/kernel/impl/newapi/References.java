/**
 * Utility class for managing flags or references.
 *
 * The reason we need flags on references is that there are dense and non-dense nodes. A dense node will have a
 * reference into the relationship group store, while a non-dense node points directly to the relationship store. On
 * retrieving a relationship reference from a dense node, we therefore have to transparently encode in the reference
 * that it actually points to a group. When the kernel then serves a relationship cursor using the reference, we need
 * to silently detect that we have a group reference, parse the groups, and setup the cursor to serve relationship
 * via this mode instead.
 *
 * The opposite problem also appears when the user acquires a relationship group reference from a non-dense node. See
 * {@link org.neo4j.kernel.impl.newapi.Read#relationships(long, long,
 * org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.RelationshipTraversalCursor)} for more details.
 *
 * Node that {@code -1} is used to encode {@link AbstractBaseRecord#NO_ID that a reference is invalid}. In terms of
 * flags {@code -1} is considered to have all flags, to setting one will not change {@code -1}. This however also
 * means that calling code must check for {@code -1} references before checking flags existence.
 *
 * Finally, a flagged reference cannot be used directly as an offset to acquire the referenced object. Before using
 * the reference, flags must be cleared with {@link References#clearFlags(long)}. To guard against using a flagged
 * reference, flagged references are marked to they appear negative.
