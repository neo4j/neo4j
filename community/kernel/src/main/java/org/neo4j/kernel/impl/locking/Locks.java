/**
 * API for managing locks.
 *
 * Locks are grabbed by clients (which generally map to a transaction, but can be any actor in the system).
 *
 * ## Upgrading and downgrading
 *
 * Shared locks allow upgrading, and exclusive locks allow downgrading. To upgrade a held shared lock to an exclusive
 * lock, simply acquire an exclusive lock and then release the shared lock. The acquire call will block other clients
 * from acquiring shared or exclusive locks, and then wait until all other holders of the shared locks have released
 * before returning.
 *
 * Downgrading a held exclusive lock is done by acquiring a shared lock, and then releasing the exclusive lock.
 *
 * ## Lock stacking
 *
 * Each call to acquire a lock must be accompanied by a call to release that same lock. A user can call acquire on the
 * same lock multiple times, thus requiring an equal number of calls to release those locks.
