/**
 * <h1>Tracers</h1>
 * <p>
 *     While monitoring is a dynamic piece of infrastructure, where monitors can be wired up and torn down on the fly,
 *     the tracing infrastructure is static and hard-coded into the database on startup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Tracing is always on, though the default implementation is very light weight, incurring almost no overhead.
 * </p>
 * <h2>The Tracers class</h2>
 * <p>
 *     This is the central hub in the tracing infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This class is responsible for choosing what tracing implementation to use, and for creating the relevant tracer
 *     components to distribute throughout the database instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The tracing implementation is determined by the {@code unsupported.dbms.tracer} setting. Two built-in implementations
 *     exist: {@code default} and {@code null}. Alternative implementations can be loaded from the
 *     classpath by referencing their {@link org.neo4j.kernel.monitoring.tracing.TracerFactory} in a
 *     {@code META-INF/services/org.neo4j.kernel.monitoring.tracing.TracerFactory}, and setting
 *     {@code unsupported.dbms.tracer} to the appropriate value.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Designing and implementing tracers</h2>
 * <p>
 *     There are two parts to tracers: the tracer implementation, which starts with the TracerFactory, and the
 *     subsystems that expose themselves to tracing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The traced subsystems are responsible for defining their own tracer and trace event interfaces, and they are
 *     responsible for getting hold of a tracer implementation through the Tracers class, and for producing trace
 *     events and feeding them with data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Traced subsystems define a hierarchy of events: large coarse grain events can contain smaller and more
 *     detailed events. Sibling events (that follow one after another in time) are typically spawned from the same
 *     parent event. The tracers and trace events are all defined as interfaces, and each interface should have a
 *     {@code NULL} field that references an implementation that does nothing, other than return other {@code NULL}
 *     implementations of any child event interfaces. The existing trace interfaces for transactions and the page
 *     cache, are good examples of this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The tracer implementations are responsible for implementing all the tracer and trace event interfaces in a way
 *     that is both fast, and robust. Robustness is important because tracer implementations are not allowed to throw
 *     exceptions, and they are not allowed to return {@code null} where a trace event is expected. Implementations
 *     may add implementation specific data to the events, if they want to report implementation specific data.
 *     They are also allowed to produce the {@code NULL} implementations that are associated with the various tracer
 *     and trace event interfaces. If, for instance, the implementation is not interested in the data that would be
 *     collected from a given trace event, then it can choose to use the {@code NULL} implementation. It could also
 *     be that something went wrong when building an event instance of the desired type, and since it cannot return
 *     {@code null} or throw exceptions, it is forced to return the {@code NULL} implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Tracer implementations should prefer to always return the same trace event implementation type for a given
 *     trace event type. Using more than one implementation type impairs JIT optimisation, as it causes the callsites
 *     in the traced code to no longer be monomorphic. Implementations should be built with performance in mind, as
 *     the code being traced is often quite important for the performance of the database.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The {@code default} and {@code null} implementation are always available, and 3rd party implementations can
 *     piggy-back on them and extend them. At least one 3rd party implementation is known at this point; the
 *     <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jfr">neo4j-jfr implementation</a>. It is recommended that
 *     those change the tracer or trace event interfaces, or add tracing to more subsystems, also make sure to keep
 *     the neo4j-jfr code base up to date.
 * </p>
