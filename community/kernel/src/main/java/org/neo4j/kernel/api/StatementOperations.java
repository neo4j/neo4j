/**
 * Interface for accessing and modifying the underlying graph.
 * A statement is executing within a {@link KernelTransaction transaction}
 * and will be able to see all previous changes made within that transaction.
 * When done using a statement it must be closed.
 *
 * Note that this interface only combines a set of interfaces that define operations that the
 * database can perform.
 *
 * One main difference between a {@link KernelTransaction} and a {@link StatementOperations}
 * is life cycle of some locks, where read locks can live within one statement,
 * whereas write locks will live for the entire transaction.
 *
 * === Method Names ===
 *
 * The most prominent entity the method deals with is the first word of the method name.
 * If dealt with in general, the word is pluralized.
 * We prefer physical entities to meta-entities (e.g. node is preferred to index and label).
 * {@link #nodesGetFromIndexLookup(org.neo4j.kernel.impl.api.index.IndexDescriptor, Object)} is a good example for both
 * of the last two rules, nodes are the physical entities we are interested in, therefore that word is first, the
 * index is just a means of getting to the nodes.
 *
 * Parameter order for all methods, should reflect the order of words in the method name, with the most prominent entity
 * being the first parameter.
 * 
 * This interface should not be implemented directly by classes providing just some parts of it all. Instead
 * implement the specific sub-interfaces.
