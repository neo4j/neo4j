/**
 * Note: This is confusing to you. What is the difference between this and {@link Locks}? Well. {@link Locks} is the
 * primary locking component in neo. However, there are lower layers that use a separate locking mechanism (this),
 * which they can do under very strict rules of engagement.
 *
 * This implementation should be removed, and it's usage should be replaced by using the regular lock manager.
 *
 *
 *
 * An implementation of this interface must guarantee that locking is completely fair:
 * - Locks should be assigned in the order which they were claimed.
 * - If a write lock is waiting, new read locks may not be issued.
 *
 * It is acceptable for an implementation to limit the number of allowed concurrent read locks.
 *
 * Write locks must be exclusive. No more than one writer may lock the same resource at any given time, and no other
 * lock types may be issued while a write lock is held.
 *
 * The simples possible solution issues the same type of mutually exclusive locks for each lock type.
 *
 * @see AbstractLockService for implementation details.
