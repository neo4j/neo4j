     * Method for calling a lambda function on many objects when it is expected that the function might
     * throw an exception. The method will catch all exceptions from all calls, and throw the first exception
     * at the end. This is equivalent to have a set of nested try{}finally{} blocks to ensure all calls are made,
     * but is generalized to any number of calls.
     *
     * For example, in FusionIndexAccessor:
     * <pre>
     *    public void drop() throws IOException
     *    {
     *        forAll( ( accessor ) -> ((IndexAccessor) accessor).drop(), nativeAccessor, spatialAccessor, luceneAccessor );
     *        dropAction.drop( indexId );
     *    }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param actionable lambda function to call on each object passed
     * @param accessors varargs array of objects to call the function on
     * @param <E> the type of exception anticipated, inferred from the lambda
     * @throws E
