 *
 * The reason for the separation between transactions and statements is isolation levels. While Neo4j is read-committed
 * isolation, a read can potentially involve multiple operations (think of a cypher statement). Within that read, or
 * statement if you will, the isolation level should be repeatable read, not read committed.
 *
 * Clearly separating between the concept of a transaction and the concept of a statement allows us to cater to this
