/**
 * Manages ownership of a piece of memory between two threads, but only allowing one thread at a time to read and write.
 * In order to separate between the two threads, they are called client and server. The only distinction between them
 * is that the client starts with access to the object, and can then hand over control to the other thread.
 *
 * This is very similar to a basic {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}, but is slightly faster as it explicitly hands
 * the object back and forth, rather than allowing arbitrary acquire/release calls, approximately doubling performance.
