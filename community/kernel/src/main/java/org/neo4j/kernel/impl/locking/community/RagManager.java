/**
 * The Resource Allocation Graph manager is used for deadlock detection. It
 * keeps track of all locked resources and transactions waiting for resources.
 * When a {@link RWLock} cannot give the lock to a transaction the tx has to
 * wait and that may lead to a deadlock. So before the tx is put into wait mode
 * the {@link RagManager#checkWaitOn} method is invoked to check if a wait of
 * this transaction will lead to a deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * The <CODE>checkWaitOn</CODE> throws a {@link DeadlockDetectedException} if
 * a deadlock would occur when the transaction would wait for the resource. That
 * will guarantee that a deadlock never occurs on a RWLock basis.
 * <p/>
 * Think of the resource allocation graph as a graph. We have two node
 * types, resource nodes (R) and tx/process nodes (T). When a transaction
 * acquires lock on some resource a relationship is added from the resource to
 * the tx (R->T) and when a transaction waits for a resource a relationship is
 * added from the tx to the resource (T->R). The only thing we need to do to see
 * if a deadlock occurs when some transaction waits for a resource is to
 * traverse the graph starting on the resource and see if we can get back
 * to the tx ( T1 wants to wait on R1 and R1->T2->R2->T3->R8->T1 <==>
 * deadlock!).
