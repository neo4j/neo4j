/**
 * A chain of transactions to apply. Transactions form a linked list, each pointing to the {@link #next()}
 * or {@code null}. This design chosen for less garbage and convenience, i.e. that we pass in a number of transactions
 * while also expecting some results for each and every one of those transactions back. The results are
 * written directly into each instance instead of creating another data structure which is then returned.
 * This is an internal class so even if it mixes arguments with results it's easier to work with,
 * requires less code... and less objects.
 *
 * State and methods are divided up into two parts, one part being the responsibility of the user to manage,
 * the other part up to the commit process to manage.
 *
 * The access pattern looks like:
 * <ol>
 * <li>=== USER ===</li>
 * <li>Construct instances</li>
 * <li>Form the linked list using {@link #next(TransactionToApply)}</li>
 * <li>Pass into {@link TransactionCommitProcess#commit(TransactionToApply, CommitEvent, TransactionApplicationMode)}</li>
 * <li>=== COMMIT PROCESS ===</li>
 * <li>Commit, where {@link #commitment(Commitment, long)} is called to store the {@link Commitment} and transaction id</li>
 * <li>Apply, where {@link #commitment()},
 * {@link #transactionRepresentation()} and {@link #next()} are called</li>
 * <li>=== USER ===</li>
 * <li>Data about the commit can now also be accessed using f.ex {@link #commitment()} or {@link #transactionId()}</li>
 * </ol>
