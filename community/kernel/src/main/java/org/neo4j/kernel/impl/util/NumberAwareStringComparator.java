/**
 * Comparator for strings that may, or may not, contain groups of digits representing numbers and where
 * those numbers should be compared for what their numeric values are, not their string representations.
 * This will solve a classic sorting issue that plain string sorting misses:
 * <ol>
 * <li>string-1</li>
 * <li>string-2</li>
 * <li>string-12</li>
 * </ol>
 * Where the above would be sorted as {@code string-1}, {@code string-12}, {@code string-2}, which may be
 * undesirable in scenarios where the number matters. This comparator will sort the strings from the
 * example above as {@code string-1}, {@code string-2}, {@code string-12}.
