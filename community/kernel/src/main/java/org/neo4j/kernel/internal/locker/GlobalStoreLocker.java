/**
 * Store locker that guarantee that only single channel ever will be opened and then closed for store locker
 * file to prevent cases where lock will be released when any of the opened channels for file will be released as
 * described in {@link FileLock} javadoc:
 * <p>
 * <b>
 * On some systems, closing a channel releases all locks held by the Java virtual machine on the underlying
 * file regardless of whether the locks were acquired via that channel or via another channel open on the same file.
 * It is strongly recommended that, within a program, a unique channel be used to acquire all locks on any given file.
 * </b>
 * </p>
 *
 * The guarantee is achieved by tracking all locked files over all instances of {@link GlobalStoreLocker}.
 *
 * Class guarantee visibility of locked files over multiple thread but do not guarantee atomicity of operations.
