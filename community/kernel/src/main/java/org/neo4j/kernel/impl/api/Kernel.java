/**
 * This is the Neo4j Kernel, an implementation of the Kernel API which is an internal component used by Cypher and the
 * Core API (the API under org.neo4j.graphdb).
 *
 * <h1>Structure</h1>
 *
 * The Kernel lets you start transactions. The transactions allow you to create "statements", which, in turn, operate
 * against the database. Statements and transactions are separate concepts due to isolation requirements. A single
 * cypher query will normally use one statement, and there can be multiple statements executed in one transaction.
 *
 * Please refer to the {@link KernelTransaction} javadoc for details.
 *
 * The architecture of the kernel is based around a layered design, where one layer performs some task, and potentially
 * delegates down to a lower layer. For instance, writing to the database will pass through
 * {@link LockingStatementOperations}, which will grab locks and delegate to {@link StateHandlingStatementOperations}
 * which will store the change in the transaction state, to be applied later if the transaction is committed.
 *
 * A read will, similarly, pass through {@link LockingStatementOperations}. It then reaches
 * {@link StateHandlingStatementOperations}, which includes any changes that exist in the current transaction, and then
 * finally {@link org.neo4j.kernel.impl.api.store.StoreReadLayer} will read the current committed state from
 * the stores or caches.
 *
 * <h1>Refactoring</h1>
 *
 * There are several sources of pain around the current state, which we hope to refactor away down the line.
 *
 * One pain is transaction state, which is maintained in the {@link org.neo4j.kernel.impl.api.state.TxState} class.
 * This class is huge and complicated, as it has been used as a gathering point for consolidating all transaction state
 * management in one place. This is now done, and the TxState class should now be refactored to be easier to understand.
 *
 * Please expand and update this as you learn things or find errors in the text above.
