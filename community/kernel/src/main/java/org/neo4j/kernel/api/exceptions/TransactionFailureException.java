/**
 * This class (in its current form - 2013-05-07) is a vector for exceptions thrown by a transaction manager, for
 * carrying the exception through the Kernel API stack to be rethrown on a higher level.
 *
 * The intention is that when the dependency on a transaction manager is gone, this class will either disappear, or
 * change into something completely different. Most likely this different thing will emerge alongside this exception
 * type while the transaction system is being refactored, and thus this class will disappear.
