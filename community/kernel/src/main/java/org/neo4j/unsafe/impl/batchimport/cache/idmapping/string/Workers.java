/**
 * Utility for running a handful of {@link Runnable} in parallel, each in its own thread.
 * {@link Runnable} instances are {@link #start(Runnable) added and started} and the caller can
 * {@link #await()} them all to finish, returning a {@link Throwable error} if any thread encountered one so
 * that the caller can decide how to handle that error. Or caller can use {@link #awaitAndThrowOnError(Class)}
 * where error from any worker would be thrown from that method.
 *
 * It's basically like using an {@link ExecutorService}, but without that "baggage" and an easier usage
 * and less code in the scenario described above.
