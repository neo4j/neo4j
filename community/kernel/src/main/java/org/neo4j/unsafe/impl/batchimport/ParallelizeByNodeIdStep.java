/**
 * Enables {@link RelationshipEncoderStep} to safely process batches in parallel.
 *
 * Using actual node ids from {@link Batch#ids}, this step compares ids from consecutive batches and
 * detects whether or not there are any overlap of ids between the batches. Batches that have no id overlap
 * can be run in parallel. Batches that do have id overlap will not be run in parallel since that would
 * introduce a chance for multiple threads updating the same cache entries of the {@link NodeRelationshipCache}
 * concurrently.
 *
 * "Why not solve this with CAS in the {@link NodeRelationshipCache}, you say"... sure, that
 * would solve the issue of updating the same cache entries concurrently, but may break a contract of
 * the batch importer that relationship ids in any chain are ordered by id. Id ordering inside chains are
 * fundamental for implementing the {@link RelationshipLinkbackStage "prev pointer" linking} in the
 * efficient way it's done currently, upholding sequential I/O access properties correctly.
 *
 * This step will have an array, {@link #concurrentNodeIds}, containing all node ids that are potentially
 * processed (by the downstream step) at any given point in time. In order to allow one more batch to be
 * executed in parallel with any other concurrently executing batches no node id in the tentative batch
 * can already exist in {@link #concurrentNodeIds}. This makes this array grow with consecutive parallelizable
 * batches until a non-parallelizable batch is encountered, at which point the array can be reset and
 * the comparison (and potential growth of it) can begin again. Implementation of this is garbage-free,
 * but fact still remains that multiple consecutive parallelizable batches will keep increasing the
 * time it takes to detect this property. Therefore there's an upper limit of 10 for the number of
 * consecutive parallelizable batches, such that even if there would theoretically be 11 consecutive
 * parallelizable batches, the 11:th will not be marked as parallelizable with the other previous 10.
