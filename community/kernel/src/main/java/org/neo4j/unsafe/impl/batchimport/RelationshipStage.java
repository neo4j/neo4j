/**
 * Imports the initial part of relationships, namely the relationship record itself and its properties.
 * Only the "next" pointers are set at this stage. The "prev" pointers are set in a
 * {@link RelationshipLinkbackStage later stage} to avoid random store access. Steps:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link InputIteratorBatcherStep} reading from {@link InputIterator} produced from {@link Input#relationships()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link AssignRelationshipIdBatchStep} assigns record ids to batches. This to have one source of id allocation
 * since there are later steps which can be multi-threaded.</li>
 * <li>{@link RelationshipPreparationStep} looks up {@link InputRelationship#startNode() start node input id} /
 * {@link InputRelationship#endNode() end node input id} from {@link IdMapper} and attaches to the batches going
 * through because that lookup is costly and this step can be parallelized.</li>
 * <li>{@link RelationshipRecordPreparationStep} creates {@link RelationshipRecord relationship record instances}
 * and initializes them with default values suitable for import.</li>
 * <li>{@link PropertyEncoderStep} encodes properties from {@link InputNode input nodes} into {@link PropertyBlock},
 * low level kernel encoded values.</li>
 * <li>{@link RelationshipEncoderStep} sets "next" pointers in {@link RelationshipRecord} by getting id
 * from {@link NodeRelationshipCache} based on node id and {@link Direction} and at the same time updating
 * that cache entry to the id of the relationship. This forms the relationship chain linked lists.</li>
 * <li>{@link EntityStoreUpdaterStep} forms {@link PropertyRecord property records} out of previously encoded
 * {@link PropertyBlock} and writes those as well as the {@link RelationshipRecord} to store.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This stage can be run multiple times, once per relationship type and new relationships are being appended
 * to the end of the store, that's why this stage accepts a relationship id to start at (firstRelationshipId).
 *
 * It is also to be said that the relationship type ids are imported descending, i.e. w/ the highest type id first
 * down to the lowest last. This simply because all records (even {@link RelationshipGroupRecord relationship groups})
 * are appended to the end, only "next" pointers can be provided in new records in the face of the sequential-only
 * I/O restriction and {@link RelationshipGroupRecord} chains must be in order of ascending type id.
