/**
 * {@link BatchImporter} which tries to exercise as much of the available resources to gain performance.
 * Or rather ensure that the slowest resource (usually I/O) is fully saturated and that enough work is
 * being performed to keep that slowest resource saturated all the time.
 * <p>
 * Overall goals: split up processing cost by parallelizing. Keep CPUs busy, keep I/O busy and writing sequentially.
 * I/O is only allowed to be read to and written from sequentially, any random access drastically reduces performance.
 * Goes through multiple stages where each stage has one or more steps executing in parallel, passing
 * batches between these steps through each stage, i.e. passing batches downstream.
