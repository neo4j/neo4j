 * One step in {@link Stage}, where a {@link Stage} is a sequence of steps. Each step works on batches.
 * Batches are typically received from an upstream step, or produced in the step itself. If there are more steps
 * {@link #setDownstream(Step) downstream} then processed batches are passed down. Each step has maximum
 * "work-ahead" size where it awaits the downstream step to catch up if the queue size goes beyond that number.
 *
 * Batches are associated with a ticket, which is simply a long value incremented for each batch.
 * It's the first step that is responsible for generating these tickets, which will stay unchanged with
 * each batch all the way through the stage. Steps that have multiple threads processing batches can process
 * received batches in any order, but must make sure to send batches to its downstream
 * (i.e. calling {@link #receive(long, Object)} on its downstream step) ordered by ticket.
