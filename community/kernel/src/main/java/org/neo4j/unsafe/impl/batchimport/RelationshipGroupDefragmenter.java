/**
 * Defragments {@link RelationshipGroupRecord} so that they end up sequential per node in the group store.
 * There's one constraint which is assumed to be true here: any relationship group that we see in the store
 * for any given {@link RelationshipGroupRecord#getOwningNode() owner} must have a lower
 * {@link RelationshipGroupRecord#getType() type} than any previous group encountered for that node,
 * i.e. all {@link RelationshipGroupRecord#getNext() next pointers} must be either
 * {@link Record#NO_NEXT_RELATIONSHIP NULL} or lower than the group id at hand. When this is true,
 * and the defragmenter verifies this constraint, the groups will be reversed so that types are instead
 * ascending and groups are always co-located.
