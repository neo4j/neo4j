/**
 * Holds information vital for making {@link RelationshipGroupDefragmenter} work the way it does.
 *
 * The defragmenter goes potentially multiple rounds through the relationship group store and each round
 * selects groups from a range of node ids. This cache can cache the groups for the nodes in this range.
 *
 * First all group counts per node are updated ({@link #incrementGroupCount(long)}).
 * Then {@link #prepare(long)} is called from lowest node id (0) and given the maximum configured memory
 * given to this cache in its constructor the highest node id to cache is returned. Then groups are
 * {@link #put(RelationshipGroupRecord)} and cached in here to later be {@link #iterator() retrieved}
 * where they are now ordered by node and type.
 * This will go on until the entire node range have been visited.
