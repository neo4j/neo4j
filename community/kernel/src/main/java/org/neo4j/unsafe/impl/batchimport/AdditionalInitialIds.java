/**
 * Migrating a store uses the {@link ParallelBatchImporter} to do so, where node/relationship stores
 * are created with data read from legacy node/relationship stores. The batch import also populates
 * a counts store, which revolves around tokens and their ids. Knowing those high token ids before hand greatly helps
 * the batch importer code do things efficiently, instead of figuring that out as it goes. When doing
 * the migration there are no token stores, although nodes and relationships gets importer with existing
 * token ids in them, so this is a way for the {@link StoreMigrator} to communicate those ids to the
 * {@link ParallelBatchImporter}.
 *
 * When actually writing out the counts store on disk the last committed transaction id at that point is also
 * stored, and that's why the {@link StoreMigrator} needs to communicate that using
 * {@link #lastCommittedTransactionId()} as well.
