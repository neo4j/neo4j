/**
 * {@link EncodingIdMapper} is an index where arbitrary ids, be it {@link String} or {@code long} or whatever
 * can be added and mapped to an internal (node) {@code long} id. The order in which ids are added can be
 * any order and so in the end when all ids have been added the index goes through a
 * {@link IdMapper#prepare(LongFunction, Collector, ProgressListener) prepare phase} where these ids are sorted
 * so that {@link IdMapper#get(Object, Group)} can execute efficiently later on.
 * <p>
 * In that sorting the ids aren't moved, but instead a {@link Tracker} created where these moves are recorded
 * and the initial data (in order of insertion) is kept intact to be able to track {@link Group} belonging among
 * other things. Since a tracker is instantiated after all ids have been added there's an opportunity to create
 * a smaller data structure for smaller datasets, for example those that fit inside {@code int} range.
 * That's why this abstraction exists so that the best suited implementation can be picked for every import.
