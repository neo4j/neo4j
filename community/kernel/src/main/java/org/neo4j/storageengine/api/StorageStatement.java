/**
 * A statement for accessing data from a {@link StoreReadLayer}. Most data about the entities of a graph
 * are accessed through this statement interface as opposed to through the {@link StoreReadLayer} directly.
 * One of the main reasons is that the access methods returns objects, like {@link Cursor cursors} which
 * are valuable to reuse over a reasonably large window to reduce garbage churn in general.
 * <p>
 * A {@link StorageStatement} must be {@link #acquire() acquired} before use. After use the statement
 * should be {@link #release() released}. After released the statement can be acquired again.
 * Creating and closing {@link StorageStatement} and there's also benefits keeping these statements opened
 * during a longer period of time, with the assumption that it's still one thread at a time using each.
 * With that in mind these statements should not be opened and closed for each operation, perhaps not even
 * for each transaction.
 * <p>
 * All cursors provided by this statement are views over data in the store. They do not interact with transaction
 * state.
