/**
 * The index progressor is a cursor like class, which allows controlled progression through the entries of an index.
 * In contrast to a cursor, the progressor does not hold value state, but rather attempts to write the next entry to a
 * Client. The client can them accept the entry, in which case next() returns, or reject it, in which case the
 * progression continues until an acceptable entry is found or the progression is done.
 *
 * A Progressor is expected to feed a single client, which is setup for example in the constructor. The typical
 * interaction goes something like
 *
 *   -- query(client) -> INDEX
 *                       progressor = new Progressor( client )
 *                       client.initialize( progressor, ... )
 *
 *   -- next() --> client
 *                 client ---- next() --> progressor
 *                        <-- accept() --
 *                                 :false
 *                        <-- accept() --
 *                                 :false
 *                        <-- accept() --
 *                                  :true
 *                 client <--------------
