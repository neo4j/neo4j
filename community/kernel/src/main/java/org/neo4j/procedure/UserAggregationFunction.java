/**
 * Declares a method as an aggregation function, meaning the method can be called from the
 * cypher query language.
 * <p>
 * An aggregation function must returned an instance of a class with two annotated methods, one annotated with
 * {@link UserAggregationUpdate} and one annotated with {@link UserAggregationResult}
 *
 * <h2>Resource declarations</h2>
 * The aggregation function method itself can contain arbitrary Java code - but in order to work with the underlying graph,
 * it must have access to the graph API. This is done by declaring fields in the function class, and annotating
 * them with the {@link Context} annotation. Fields declared this way are automatically injected with the
 * requested resource. This is how functions gain access to APIs to do work with.
 * <p>
 * All fields in the class containing the function declaration must either be static; or it must be public, non-final
 * and annotated with {@link Context}.
 * <p>
 * Resources supported by default are as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.logging.Log}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.procedure.TerminationGuard}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle and state</h2>
 * The class that declares your function method may be re-instantiated before each call. Because of this,
 * no regular state can be stored in the fields of the function.
 * <p>
 * If you want to maintain state between invocations to your function, simply use a static field. Note that
 * functions may be called concurrently, meaning you need to take care to ensure the state you store in
 * static fields can be safely accessed by multiple callers simultaneously.
