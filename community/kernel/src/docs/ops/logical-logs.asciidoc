Logical logs
============

Logical logs in Neo4j are the journal of which operations happens and are the source of truth in scenarios where the
database needs to be recovered after a crash or similar. Logs are rotated every now and then (defaults to when they
surpass 250 Mb in size) and the amount of legacy logs to keep can be configured. Purpose of keeping a history of
logical logs include being able to serve incremental backups as well as keeping an HA cluster running.

For any given configuration at least the latest non-empty logical log will be kept, but configuration can be supplied
to control how much more to keep. There are several different means of controlling it and the format in which
configuration is supplied is:

[source]
----
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=<true/false>
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=<amount> <type>
----

For example:

[source]
----
# Will keep logical logs indefinitely
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=true

# Will keep only the most recent non-empty log
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=false

# Will keep logical logs which contains any transaction committed within 30 days
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=30 days

# Will keep logical logs which contains any of the most recent 500 000 transactions
dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=500k txs
----
