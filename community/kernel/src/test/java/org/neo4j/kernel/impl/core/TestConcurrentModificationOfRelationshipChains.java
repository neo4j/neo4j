/**
 * Tests a specific case of cache poisoning that involves the relationship chain of a node, the index the node has on it
 * and a deleted relationship.
 * The bug manifests thus:
 * A Node with at least grab_size+1 relationships is loaded.
 * The first batch of relationships is loaded
 * The relationships are traversed until the last one is reached in this batch.
 * The relationship that is the first of the next batch (the one pointed to by the current one in the iteration) is
 *  deleted without going through the node - a reference is acquired and deleted from there.
 * The cache is now poisoned. The next() call on the relationship iterator of that node will cause it to fail with
 *  a NotFoundException since the relationship chain position for the node points to something that is no longer in
 *  use. Since the load will fail the position is never updated and will always fail.
 *
 *  The tests provided form a matrix. One axis is the deletion happening from the same or different threads. The
 *   other is the read happening from the iterator already acquired or from a node re-read from scratch. A fix should
 *   make all 4 green.
