         * If you want to change or fix this test, you sort of have to read what follows.
         *
         * I can hear you, exasperated, giving up all hope, thinking "Oh noes! Another one of those tests".
         * I know.
         * I understand.
         * I sympathise.
         * After all, I wrote it.
         * So let me, dear reader, to try and show you what is going on here.
         * The bug is the following: A thread, let's call it theTriggeringOne, will read in a record through a
         * PersistentRow. It locks it, it writes stuff to it. In the mean time, before theTriggeringOne releases the lock,
         * another thread, we name it affectionately theEvilOne, will try to *read* (hence, no locks on the object)
         * the same record. It, too, will attempt to go to the same PersistentRow, stored now in the row map in
         * PersistenceWindowPool. It will mark it, but not lock it, because theTriggeringOne still holds the lock. Now,
         * theTriggeringOne releases the lock. It does not write out the changes though, because well, theEvilOne has it
         * already marked.
         * A third thread comes in now, which we'll call theOverwrittenOne. That one grabs a brick for the same position,
         * but in doing so it triggers a refresh of the bricks (actually, any thread could have done that, but this way
         * we don't need to introduce a 4th thread). That leave the contended file position being now memory mapped. Note
         * how we are suddenly in a world of crap, since we have one PersistenceWindow *and* a PersistenceRow, which
         * btw is dirty, for the same file position. I assume you can guess the rest. theOverwrittenOne will write
         * something, release and flush it, and theEvilOne will finish its read operation right after that, release
         * the row and then its contents will be written out, overwriting theOverwrittenOne's changes.
         *
         * Now, the test below reproduces the exact scenario above. The thread names are the same. Synchronization is
         * achieved mostly through latches. There is one point though where an external breakpoint is required, and
         * that is between theEvilOne marks and attempts to lock the row that theTriggeringOne already has locked.
         * The breakpoint is added on PersistenceRow.lock() and what it does is it resumes theEvilOne which is
         * suspended by theTriggeringOne on its startup. That's what the 3 breakpoint handlers do - one is for suspending
         * theEvilOne on startup, the other is for pausing theTriggeringOne before releasing the lock and the
         * lock handler allows theTriggeringOne to continue and release the lock when theEvilOne marks the row.
         *
         * The rest is details explained inline.
