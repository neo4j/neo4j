/**
 * Traversing a relationship chain has no consistency guarantees that there will be no change between
 * starting the traversal and continuing through it. Therefore relationships might get deleted right
 * when, or before, traversing there. The previous behaviour was to be aware of that and simply abort
 * the chain traversal.
 *
 * Given the fact that relationship ids will not be reused within the same database session the
 * behaviour has been changed to continue through such unused relationships, reading its pointers,
 * until arriving at either {@code -1} or a used relationship.
