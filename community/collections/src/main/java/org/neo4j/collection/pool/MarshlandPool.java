     * This is a somewhat complicated class. What it does is to keep a single-slot local pool for each thread that
     * uses it, to allow very rapid claim calls that don't need to communicate with other threads. However, this is
     * dangerous, since pooled objects may then be lost when threads die.
     *
     * To mitigate this, the local slots are tracked by phantom references, which allows us to use a reference queue
     * to find objects that used to "belong" to now-dead threads.
     *
     * So, our algo for claiming is:
     *  - Check thread local for available object.
     *  - If none found, check the reference queue
     *  - If none found, use the delegate pool.
