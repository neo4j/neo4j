        //
        // 1. The UDC can't depend on server components, because it has to work in embedded. So the read side of this
        //    in DefaultUdcInformationCollector is invoked by reflection. For that reason we need the actual list of
        //    user agents in a running system to be statically accessible.
        //
        // 2. On the write side, Jersey's contract is that we provide a class which it instantiates itself. So we need
        //    to write the list of user agents from any instance. However Jersey will only create one instance, so we
        //     can rely on the constructor being called only once in the running system.
        //
        // 3. For testing purposes, we would like to be able to create independent instances; otherwise we get problems
        //    with global state being carried over between tests.
