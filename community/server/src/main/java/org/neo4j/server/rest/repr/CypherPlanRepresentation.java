/**
 * This takes a function that resolves to a {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.ExecutionPlanDescription}, and it does so for two reasons:
 *  - The plan description needs to be fetched *after* the result is streamed to the user
 *  - This method is recursive, so it's not enough to just pass in the execution plan to the root call of it
 *    subsequent inner calls could not re-use that execution plan (that would just lead to an infinite loop)
