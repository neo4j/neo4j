/**
 * A set of classes that we trust unknown entities to work with. These will be accessible to users that have remote access
 * to a Neo4j database.
 *
 * Please make sure that, when you add a class to this whitelist, it does not allow any sort of side effects that could
 * be dangerous, such as accessing the file system or starting remote connections or threads, unless we clearly know
 * the effect of it.
 *
 * Assume that people using these classes will be using a Neo4j database that runs in a co-located environment, and that
 * the world will burn if someone is able to access a database they are not supposed to have access to.
 *
 * This White List should not be end-user configurable. If we let end-users set up their own whitelists, then each database
 * would have it's own "language" for extension, which will lead to massive complications in the longer term. Better
 * to have an authoritative white list that is the same for all databases.
