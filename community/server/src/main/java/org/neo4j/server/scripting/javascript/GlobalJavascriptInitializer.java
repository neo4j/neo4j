/**
 * Forgive me Kent Beck, for I have sinned.
 *
 * Rhino's security model means we need to globally define it, so that horridness
 * has been delegated to this class.
 *
 * It allows initializing the global javascript context as either sandboxed or unsafe.
 * If you initialize it twice and ask for different modes, an exception will be thrown
 * as the mode cannot be changed after initialization.
 *
 * We could do some crazy stuff and build a context factory that can be hooked into after
 * the fact and modified, but the plan is to get rid of the ability to switch between unsafe
 * and sandboxed modes, and only allow sandboxed. Unsafe exists for backwards compatibility.
