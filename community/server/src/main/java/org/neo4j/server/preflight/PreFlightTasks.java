/**
 * These are tasks that are run on server startup that may take a long time
 * to execute, such as recovery, upgrades and so on.
 *
 * This implementation still needs some work, because of some of the refactoring
 * done regarding the NeoServer. Specifically, some of these tasks verify that
 * properties files exist and are valid. Other preflight tasks we might want to
 * add could be auto-generating config files if they don't exist and creating required
 * directories.
 *
 * All of these (including auto-generating neo4j.properties and creating directories)
 * except validating and potentially generating neo4j-server.properties depend on having
 * the server configuration available. Eg. we can't both ensure that file exists within these
 * tests, while at the same time depending on that file existing.
 *
 * The validation is not a problem, because we will refactor the server config to use the
 * new configuration system from the kernel, which automatically validates itself.
 *
 * Ensuring the config file exists (and potentially auto-generating it) is a problem.
 * Either this need to be split into tasks that have dependencies, and tasks that don't.
 *
 * Although, it seems it is only this one edge case, so perhaps accepting that and adding
 * code to the bootstrapper to ensure the config file exists is acceptable.
