A quick hack to get a standalone version
of the graph visualization.
###

define(
  ['./standaloneVisualization'
   './DataBrowserView'
   'ribcage/View'
   'lib/amd/jQuery'], 
  (template, DataBrowserView, View, $) ->
  
    class StandaloneVisualizationView extends View
      
      template : template
      
      initialize : (opts) ->
        @dbView = new DataBrowserView(opts)
        @dbView.switchToVisualizedView()

      render : ->
        $(@el).html @template(  )
        @dbView.attach($("#contents"))
        @dbView.render()
        return this

      remove : =>
        super()
)
