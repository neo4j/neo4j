      a model or collection as an attribute.
      
      Takes care of setting fetch and save
      methods on the model/collection appropriately,
      and adds hooks into this models fetch
      and toJSON methods to ensure fetch calls
      and saves propagate correctly.
      
      @param name is the property name to use and to fetch data via
      @param type is the model or collection class (or any object with a deserialize method)
