Traversals are performed from a start node.
The traversal is controlled by the URI and the body sent with the request.

returnType:: The kind of objects in the response is determined by 'traverse/\{returnType}' in the URL.
 +returnType+ can have one of these values:
 * +node+
 * +relationship+
 * +path+ - contains full representations of start and end node, the rest are URIs
 * +fullpath+ - contains full representations of all nodes and relationships

To decide how the graph should be traversed you can use these parameters in the request body:

order:: Decides in which order to visit nodes. Possible values:
 * +breadth_first+ - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[Breadth-first search]
 * +depth_first+ - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[Depth-first search]
relationships:: Decides which relationship types and directions should be followed.
 The direction can be one of:
 * +all+
 * +in+
 * +out+
uniqueness:: Decides how uniqueness should be calculated. Possible values:
 * +node_global+
 * +none+
 * +relationship_global+
 * +node_path+
 * +relationship_path+
prune_evaluator:: Decides whether the traverser should continue down that path or if it should be pruned so that the traverser won't continue down that path.
 You can write your own prune evaluator or use the built-in +none+ prune evaluator.
return filter:: Decides whether the current position should be included in the result.
 You can provide your own code for this, or use one of the built-in filters:
 * +all+
 * +all_but_start_node+
max_depth:: Is a short-hand way of specifying a prune evaluator which prunes after a certain depth.
 If not specified a max depth of 1 is used and if a +prune_evaluator+ is specified instead of a +max_depth+, no max depth limit is set.

The +position+ object in the body of the +return_filter+ and +prune_evaluator+ is a
+http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/Path.html[Path]+
object representing the path from the start node to the current traversal position.

Out of the box, the REST API supports JavaScript code in filters/evaluators.
See the examples for the exact syntax of the request.
