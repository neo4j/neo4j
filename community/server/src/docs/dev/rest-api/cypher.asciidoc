== Cypher queries ==

The Neo4j REST API allows querying with Cypher, see <<cypher-query-lang>>.
The results are returned as a list of string headers (+columns+), and a +data+ part,
consisting of a list of all rows, every row consisting of a list of REST representations
of the field value -- +Node+, +Relationship+, +Path+ or any simple value like +String+.

[TIP]
In order to speed up queries in repeated scenarios, try not to use literals but replace them with parameters wherever possible in order to let the server cache query plans, see <<rest-api-send-queries-with-parameters>> for details.
