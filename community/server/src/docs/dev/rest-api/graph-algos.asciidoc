== Built-in Graph Algorithms ==

Neo4j comes with a number of built-in graph algorithms.
They are performed from a start node.
The traversal is controlled by the URI and the body sent with the request.

algorithm:: The algorithm to choose. If not set, default is +shortestPath+.
 +algorithm+ can have one of these values:
 * +shortestPath+
 * +allSimplePaths+
 * +allPaths+
 * +dijkstra+ (optional with +cost_property+ and +default_cost+ parameters)

max_depth:: The maximum depth as an integer for the algorithms like ShortestPath, where applicable.
Default is +1+.
