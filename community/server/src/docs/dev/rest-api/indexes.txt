== Indexes ==

An index can contain either nodes or relationships.

NOTE: To create an index with default configuration, simply start using it by adding nodes/relationships to it. It will then be automatically created for you.

What default configuration means depends on how you have configured your database.
If you haven't changed any indexing configuration, it means the indexes will be using a Lucene-based backend.

All the examples below show you how to do operations on node indexes, but all of them are just as applicable
to relationship indexes. Simple change the "node" part of the URL to "relationship".

If you want to customize the index settings, see <<rest-api-create-node-index-with-configuration>>.
