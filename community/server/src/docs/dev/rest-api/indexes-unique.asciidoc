== Unique Indexing ==

For uniqueness enforcements, there are two modes:

* URL Parameter `unique=get_or_create`: Create a new node/relationship and index it if no existing one can be found.
If an existing node/relationship is found, discard the sent data and return the existing node/relationship.

* URL Parameter `unique=create_or_fail`: Create a new node/relationship if no existing one can be found in the index.
If an existing node/relationship is found, return a conflict error.

For more information, see <<transactions-unique-nodes>>.
