== Unique Indexing ==

NOTE: As of Neo4j 2.0, unique constraints have been added. These make Neo4j enforce the uniqueness,
guaranteeing that uniqueness is maintained. See <<graphdb-neo4j-schema-constraints>> for details about this.

For uniqueness enforcements, there are two modes:

* URL Parameter `uniqueness=get_or_create`: Create a new node/relationship and index it if no existing one can be found. If an existing node/relationship is found, discard the sent data and return the existing node/relationship.

* URL Parameter `uniqueness=create_or_fail`: Create a new node/relationship if no existing one can be found in the index. If an existing node/relationship is found, return a conflict error.

For more information, see <<transactions-unique-nodes>>.
