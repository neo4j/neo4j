Server Performance Tuning
=========================

At the heart of the Neo4j server is a regular Neo4j storage engine instance.
That engine can be tuned in the same way as the other embedded configurations, using the same file format.

Specifying Neo4j tuning properties
----------------------------------

In the server distribution <<file-locations, _neo4j.conf_>> is the main configuration file for Neo4j.
On restarting the server the tuning enhancements specified in this file will be loaded and configured into the underlying database engine.

Specifying JVM tuning properties
--------------------------------

Tuning the standalone server is achieved by editing the _neo4j-wrapper.conf_ file in the +conf+ directory of +NEO4J_HOME+.

Edit the following properties:

.neo4j-wrapper.conf JVM tuning properties
[options="header", cols="<m,<"]
|====================
| Property Name                 | Meaning
| dbms.memory.heap.initial_size | initial heap size (in MB)
| dbms.memory.heap.max_size     | maximum heap size (in MB)
| dbms.jvm.additional           | additional literal JVM parameter
|====================
