Server Performance Tuning
=========================

At the heart of the Neo4j server is a regular Neo4j storage engine instance.
That engine can be tuned in the same way as the other embedded configurations, using the same file format.
The only difference is that the server must be told where to find the fine-tuning configuration.

.Quick info
***********
* The _conf/neo4j.properties_ file is a standard configuration file that databases load in order to tune their memory use
***********

Specifying Neo4j tuning properties
----------------------------------

The _conf/neo4j-server.properties_ file in the server distribution, is the main configuration file for the server.
In this file we can specify a second properties file that contains the database tuning settings (that is, the _neo4j.properties_ file).
This is done by setting a single property to point to a valid _neo4j.properties_ file:

[source]
----
org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties={neo4j.properties file}
----
 
On restarting the server the tuning enhancements specified in the _neo4j.properties_ file will be loaded and configured into the underlying database engine.

Specifying JVM tuning properties
--------------------------------

Tuning the standalone server is achieved by editing the _neo4j-wrapper.conf_ file in the +conf+ directory of +NEO4J_HOME+.

Edit the following properties:

.neo4j-wrapper.conf JVM tuning properties
[options="header", cols="<m,<"]
|====================
| Property Name             | Meaning
| wrapper.java.initmemory   | initial heap size (in MB)
| wrapper.java.maxmemory    | maximum heap size (in MB)
| wrapper.java.additional   | additional literal JVM parameter
|====================
