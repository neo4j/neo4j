2.2.1
-----
o Fixed issue with 4xx HTTP response codes not including proper ClientError status
o HTTP responses containing errors in the form of server stack traces now do so
  using the key 'stackTrace' as opposed to 'stacktrace'

o Fixed NPE in Neo4jJsonCodec when serializing maps containing null keys
o Disallow directory listings

2.2.0-M04
---------
o Auth now applies to all REST endpoints, if enabled
o Auth no longer uses tokens, relying only on username and password.
o Returned paths ends with '/' in response to "GET /". This avoids an unnecessary redirect,
  for drivers that (properly) follow hyperlinks.
o A couple of bugs regarding handling of labels in BatchInserter fixed.

2.2.0-M01
---------
o Authentication and authorization functionality is now available
  through the REST API

  through the use of the same logging framework

-----
o Fixes issue with transactions leaking when there is an exception while rendering the response

2.0.0-RC1
---------
o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated method org.neo4j.server.AbstractNeoServer#stopServerOnly(). To stop the server use
  org.neo4j.server.AbstractNeoServer#stop(). If you would like to disconnect the database life cycle from server control
  use org.neo4j.server.WrappingNeoServer.
o BREAKING CHANGE: org.neo4j.server.database.Database is now an interface. Direct uses of the class can be replaced by
  one of its implementations.
o Transactional endpoint status codes are now textual rather than numeric. Since the transactional endpoint was
  introduced in the 2.0.0 series, it is not considered a breaking change. It will, however, require modifying client
  code that depends on the numeric status codes.
