OSGi setup
==========

In http://www.osgi.org/[OSGi] - related contexts like a number of Application Servers (e.g. http://glassfish.java.net/[Glassfish] )
and http://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse] - based systems, Neo4j can be set up explicitly rather than being discovered by the Java Service Loader
mechanism.


== Simple OSGi Activator scenario ==

As seen in the following example, instead of relying on the Classloading of the Neo4j kernal, the Neo4j bundles are treated as library bundles,
and services like the IndexProviders and CacheProviders are explicitly instantiated, configured and registered. Just make the necessary jars available
as wrapped library bundles, so all needed classes are exported and seen by the bundle containing the Activator.
