*Explore the graph, one query at a time.*

Neo4j Browser is http://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/[Neo4j's] built-in client application, a mashup of a REPL, data visualization and lightweight IDE.

== Goals ==

* developer focused
* every interaction is a demonstration
* uses only public APIs
* for modern browsers, with reasonable fallbacks

== Development ==

Run in development mode::

  * run neo4j server
  * npm install -g grunt-cli
  * run grunt server in browser
+
This sets up localhost:9000 to run server and browser. Any local changes will be applied here immediatley by reloading the page.
