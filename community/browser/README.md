Neo4j Browser
=============

*Explore the graph, one query at a time.* 

Neo4j Browser is [Neo4j's](http://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/) built-in client application, a mashup of a REPL, data visualization and lightweight IDE.


Goals:

- developer focused
- every interaction is a demonstration
- uses only public APIs
- for modern browsers, with reasonable fallbacks
