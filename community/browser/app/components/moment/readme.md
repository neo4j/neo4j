Added Durations.

Revamped parser to support parsing non-separated strings (YYYYMMDD vs YYYY-MM-DD).

Various bugfixes.

There are a few things deprecated in the 1.6.0 release.

1. The format tokens `z` and `zz` (timezone abbreviations like EST CST MST etc) will no longer be supported. Due to inconsistent browser support, we are unable to consistently produce this value. See [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/162) for more background.

2. The method `moment.fn.native` is deprecated in favor of `moment.fn.toDate`. There continue to be issues with Google Closure Compiler throwing errors when using `native`, even in valid instances.

3. The way to customize am/pm strings is being changed. This would only affect you if you created a custom language file. For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/pull/222).
