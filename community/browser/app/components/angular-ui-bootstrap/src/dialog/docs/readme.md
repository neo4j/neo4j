The `$dialog` service allows you to open dialogs and message boxes from within your controllers. Very useful in case loading dialog content in the DOM up-front is tedious or not desired.

Creating custom dialogs is straightforward: create a partial view, its controller and reference them when using the service.
Generic message boxes (title, message and buttons) are also provided for your convenience.

For more information, see the [dialog readme](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/blob/master/src/dialog/README.md) on github.
