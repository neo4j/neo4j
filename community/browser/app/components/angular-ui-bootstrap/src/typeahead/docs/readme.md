Typeahead is a AngularJS version of [Twitter Bootstrap typeahead plugin](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead)

This directive can be used to quickly create elegant typeheads with any form text input.

It is very well integrated into the AngularJS as:

* it uses the same, flexible syntax as the [select directive](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:select)
* works with promises and it means that you can retrieve matches using the `$http` service with minimal effort
