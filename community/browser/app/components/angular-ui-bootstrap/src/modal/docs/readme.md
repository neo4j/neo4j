`modal` is a directive that reuses `$dialog` service to provide simple creation of modals that are already in your DOM without the hassle of creating partial views and controllers.

The directive shares `$dialog` global options.

For more information, see the [dialog readme](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/blob/master/src/dialog/README.md) on github.
