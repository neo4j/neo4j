        p Neo4j is a graph database. You can store any data in Neo4j, then
          | ask questions about how that data is related.

          |  Database
        p.lead Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.
      .col-sm-5
        p The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called Properties.
          | Let's draw a social graph of our friends on the Neo4j team:
        ol
          li Start by drawing a circle for the node
          li Add the name Emil
          li Note that he is from Sweden
        ul
          li Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
          li Data is stored as Properties
          li Properties are simple name/value pairs

        p.lead Associate a set of nodes.
      .col-sm-5
        p Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member.
          | In our social graph, we'll label each node that represents a Person.
        ol
          li Apply the label "Person" to the node we created for Emil
          li Color "Person" nodes red
        ul
          li A node can have zero or more labels
          li Labels do not have any properties

        h3 More Nodes
        p.lead Schema-free, nodes can have a mix of common and unique properties.
      .col-sm-5
        p Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple
          | as adding more records. We'll add a few more nodes:
        ol
          li Emil has a klout score of 99
          li Johan, from Sweden, who is learning to surf
          li Ian, from England, who is an author
          li Rik, from Belgium, has a cat named Orval
          li Allison, from California, who surfs
        ul
          li Similar nodes can have different properties
          li Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
          li Neo4j can store billions of nodes

        p.summary
          | The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two nodes,
          | add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.
        p
          | In our social graph, we simply say who KNOWS whom:
        ol
          li Emil KNOWS Johan and Ian
          li Johan KNOWS Ian and Rik
          li Rik and Ian KNOWS Allison
        ul
          li Relationships always have direction
          li Relationships always have a type
          li Relationships form patterns of data

        h3 Relationship properties
        p.lead Store information shared by two nodes.
      .col-sm-5
        p.summary
          | In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also
          | contain properties.
          | Looking more closely at Emil's relationships, note that:
        ul
          li Emil has known Johan since 2001
          li Emil rates Ian 5 (out of 5)
          li Everyone else can have similar relationship properties
