/**
 * A cursor is an object that moves to point to different locations in a data structure.
 * The abstraction originally comes from mechanical slide rules, which have a "cursor" which
 * slides to point to different positions on the ruler.
 * <p>
 * Each position a cursor points to is referred to as a "row".
 * <p>
 * Access to the current row is done by subtyping this interface and adding accessor methods. If no call to
 * {@link #next()} has been done, or if it returned false, then such accessor methods throw {@link
 * IllegalStateException}.
