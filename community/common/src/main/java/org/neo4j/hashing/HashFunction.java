     * This hash function is based on xxHash (XXH64 variant), but modified to work incrementally on 8-byte blocks
     * instead of on 32-byte blocks. Basically, the 32-byte block hash loop has been removed, so we use the 8-byte
     * block tail-loop for the entire input.
     * <p>
     * This hash function is roughly twice as fast as the hash function used for index entries since 2.2.0, about 30%
     * faster than optimised murmurhash3 implementations though not as fast as optimised xxHash implementations due to
     * the smaller block size. It is allocation free, unlike its predecessor. And it retains most of the excellent
     * statistical properties of xxHash, failing only the "TwoBytes" and "Zeroes" keyset tests in SMHasher, passing 12
     * out of 14 tests. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Cyan4973/status/899995095549698049">Yann Collet on
     * twitter</a>, this modification is expected to mostly cause degraded performance, and worsens some of the
     * avalanche statistics.
     * <p>
     * This hash function is stateless, so the returned instance can be freely cached and accessed concurrently by
     * multiple threads.
     * <p>
     * The <a href="http://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/">xxHash</a> algorithm is originally by Yann Collet, and this
     * implementation is with inspiration from Vsevolod Tolstopyatovs implementation in the
     * <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Zero-Allocation-Hashing">Zero Allocation Hashing</a> library.
