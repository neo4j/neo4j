= Testing your extension

Neo4j provides tools to help you write integration tests for your extensions.
You can access this toolkit by adding the following test dependency to your project:

["source","xml","unnumbered","2",presubs="attributes"]
--------
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.neo4j.test</groupId>
   <artifactId>neo4j-harness</artifactId>
   <version>{neo4j-version}</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
--------

The test toolkit provides a mechanism to start a Neo4j instance with custom configuration and with extensions of your choice.
It also provides mechanisms to specify data fixtures to include when starting Neo4j.

.Usage example
[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-harness
source=org/neo4j/harness/doc/ExtensionTestingDocTest.java
tag=testExtension

If you are using the JUnit test framework, there is a JUnit rule available as well. Note the use of `server.httpURI().resolve( "myExtension" )` to ensure that the correct base URI is used.
