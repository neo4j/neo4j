Server Plugins 
==============

.Quick info
***********
* The server's functionality can be extended by adding plugins.
* Plugins are user-specified code which extend the capabilities of the database, nodes, or relationships. 
* The neo4j server will then advertise the plugin functionality within representations as clients interact via HTTP.
***********

Plugins provide an easy way to extend the Neo4j REST API with new functionality, without the need to
invent your own API.
Think of plugins as server-side scripts that can add functions for retrieving and manipulating nodes, relationships, paths, properties or indices.

[TIP]
If you want to have full control over your API, and are willing to put in the effort, and understand the risks, then Neo4j server also provides hooks for <<server-unmanaged-extensions,unmanaged extensions>> based on JAX-RS.

The needed classes reside in the http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22org.neo4j%22%20AND%20a%3A%22server-api%22[org.neo4j:server-api] jar file.
See the linked page for downloads and instructions on how to include it using dependency management.
For Maven projects, add the Server API dependencies in your +pom.xml+ like this:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>server-api</artifactId>
  <version>${neo4j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

_Where $\{neo4j-version} is the intended version._

To create a plugin, your code must inherit from the http://components.neo4j.org/server-api/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/server/plugins/ServerPlugin.html[ServerPlugin] class.
Your plugin should also:

* ensure that it can produce an (Iterable of) Node, Relationship or Path, or any Java primitive or String
* specify parameters,
* specify a point of extension and of course 
* contain the application logic.
* make sure that the discovery point type in the +@PluginTarget+ and the +@Source+ parameter are of the same type.

// link Node/Rel/Path javadocs here?

An example of a plugin which augments the database (as opposed to nodes or relationships) follows:

.Get all nodes or relationships plugin
[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-server-examples
source=org/neo4j/examples/server/plugins/GetAll.java
tag=GetAll
classifier=sources
----

The full source code is found here:
https://github.com/neo4j/community/blob/{neo4j-git-tag}/server-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/server/plugins/GetAll.java[GetAll.java]

.Find the shortest path between two nodes plugin
[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-server-examples
source=org/neo4j/examples/server/plugins/ShortestPath.java
tag=ShortestPath
classifier=sources
----

The full source code is found here:
https://github.com/neo4j/community/blob/{neo4j-git-tag}/server-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/server/plugins/ShortestPath.java[ShortestPath.java]


To deploy the code, simply compile it into a .jar file and place it onto the server classpath (which by
convention is the plugins directory under the Neo4j server home directory).

[TIP]
Make sure the directories listings are retained in the jarfile by either building with default Maven, or with `jar -cvf myext.jar *`, making sure
to jar directories instead of specifying single files.

The '.jar' file must include the file 'META-INF/services/org.neo4j.server.plugins.ServerPlugin' with the fully qualified name of the implementation class.
This is an example with multiple entries, each on a separate line:

[source]
----
include::../org.neo4j.server.plugins.ServerPlugin[]
----

The code above makes an extension visible in the database representation (via the +@PluginTarget+ annotation)
whenever it is served from the Neo4j Server.
Simply changing the +@PluginTarget+ parameter to +Node.class+ or +Relationship.class+ allows us to target those parts of the data model should we wish.
The functionality extensions provided by the plugin are automatically advertised in representations on the wire.
For example, clients can discover the extension implemented by the above plugin easily by examining the representations
they receive as responses from the server, e.g. by performing a +GET+ on the default database URI:
 
[source, shell]
----
curl -v http://localhost:7474/db/data/
----

// test the above!

The response to the +GET+ request will contain (by default) a JSON container that itself contains a container
called "extensions" where the available plugins are listed.
In the following case, we only have the +GetAll+ plugin registered with the server, so only its extension functionality is available.
Extension names will be automatically assigned, based on method names, if not specifically specified using the +@Name+ annotation.

[source, javascript]
----
{
"extensions-info" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext",
"node" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node",
"node_index" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/index/node",
"relationship_index" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/index/relationship",
"reference_node" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/0",
"extensions_info" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext",
"extensions" : {
  "GetAll" : {
    "get_all_nodes" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/get_all_nodes",
    "get_all_relationships" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/getAllRelationships"
  }
}
----

// generate the above output from a test
 
Performing a +GET+ on one of the two extension URIs gives back the meta information about the service:

[source, shell]
----
curl http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/get_all_nodes
----

// try this one as well!

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "extends" : "graphdb",
  "description" : "Get all nodes from the Neo4j graph database",
  "name" : "get_all_nodes",
  "parameters" : [ ]
}
----

To use it, just +POST+ to this URL, with parameters as specified in the description and encoded as JSON data content.
F.ex for calling the +shortest path+ extension (URI gotten from a +GET+ to http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/123):
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/node/123/shortestPath \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/456&depth=5"}'
---- 
If everything is OK a response code +200+ and a list of zero or more items will be returned.
If nothing is returned (null returned from extension) an empty result and response code +204+ will be returned.
If the extension throws an exception response code +500+ and a detailed error message is returned.

Extensions that do any kind of write operation will have to manage their own transactions, i.e. transactions aren't managed automatically.

Through this model, any plugin can naturally fit into the general hypermedia scheme that Neo4j espouses - meaning that
clients can still take advantage of abstractions like  Nodes, Relationships and Paths with a straightforward upgrade
path as servers are enriched with plugins (old clients don't break).
