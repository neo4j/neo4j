= Using Cypher in an unmanaged extension

If we want to execute Cypher queries from an unmanaged extension we can use `ExecutionEngine` to do so.
You should only generate _one_ instance of this class which can be used to execute Cypher queries for all requests.

For example, the following unmanaged extension retrieves a person's colleagues using Cypher:

Our `findColleagues` method will now respond to +GET+ requests at the URI: +http://\{neo4j_server}:\{neo4j_port}/examples/unmanaged/colleagues-cypher-execution/\{personName}+. e.g.

curl http://localhost:7474/examples/unmanaged/colleagues-cypher-execution/Keanu%20Reeves
