= Using Cypher in an unmanaged extension

You can execute Cypher queries by using the `GraphDatabaseService` that is injected into the extension.

[NOTE]
In Neo4j versions prior to 2.2 you had to retrieve an `ExecutionEngine` to execute queries.
This has been deprecated, and we recommend you to update any existing code to use `GraphDatabaseService` instead.

For example, the following unmanaged extension retrieves a person's colleagues using Cypher:

Our `findColleagues` method will now respond to +GET+ requests at the URI: +http://\{neo4j_server}:\{neo4j_port}/examples/unmanaged/colleagues-cypher-execution/\{personName}+. e.g.

curl http://localhost:7474/examples/unmanaged/colleagues-cypher-execution/Keanu%20Reeves
