/**
 * Signifies how a query is executed, as well as what side effects and results could be expected from the query.
 * <p>
 * In Cypher there are three different modes of execution:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Normal execution,</li>
 * <li>execution with the <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/execution-plans/">{@code PROFILE}</a> directive,
 * and</li>
 * <li>execution with the <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/execution-plans/">{@code EXPLAIN}</a>
 * directive.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Instances of this class contain the required information to be able to tell these different execution modes apart.
 * It also contains information about what effects the query could have, and whether it could yield any results, in
 * form
 * of the {@link QueryType QueryType enum}.
 * <p>
 * Queries executed with the {@code PROFILE} directive can have side effects and produce results in the same way as a
 * normally executed method. The difference being that the user has expressed an interest in seeing the plan used to
 * execute the query, and that this plan will (after execution completes) be annotated with
 * {@linkplain ExecutionPlanDescription#getProfilerStatistics() profiling information} from the execution of the query.
 * <p>
 * Queries executed with the {@code EXPLAIN} directive never have any side effects, nor do they ever yield any rows in
 * the results, the sole purpose of this mode of execution is to
 * {@linkplain Result#getExecutionPlanDescription() get a description of the plan} that <i>would</i> be executed
 * if/when the query is executed normally (or under {@code PROFILE}).
