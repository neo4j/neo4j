/**
 * Represents the result of {@link GraphDatabaseService#execute(String, java.util.Map) executing} a query.
 * <p>
 * The result is comprised of a number of rows, potentially computed lazily, with this result object being an iterator
 * over those rows. Each row is represented as a <code>{@link Map}&lt;{@link String}, {@link Object}&gt;</code>, the
 * keys in this map are the names of the columns in the row, as specified by the {@code return} clause of the query,
 * and the values of the map is the corresponding computed value of the expression in the {@code return} clause. Each
 * row will thus have the same set of keys, and these keys can be retrieved using the
 * {@linkplain #columns() columns-method}.
 * <p>
 * To ensure that any resource, including transactions bound to the query, are properly freed, the result must either
 * be fully exhausted, by means of the {@linkplain java.util.Iterator iterator protocol}, or the result has to be
 * explicitly closed, by invoking the {@linkplain #close() close-method}.
 * <p>
 * Idiomatic use of the Result object would look like this:
 * <pre><code>
 * try ( Result result = graphDatabase.execute( query, parameters ) )
 * {
 *     while ( result.hasNext() )
 *     {
 *         Map&lt;String, Object&gt; row = result.next();
 *         for ( String key : result.columns() )
 *         {
 *             System.out.printf( "%s = %s%n", key, row.get( key ) );
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * If the result consists of only a single column, or if only one of the columns is of interest, a projection can be
 * extracted using {@link #columnAs(String)}. This produces a new iterator over the values of the named column. It
 * should be noted that this iterator consumes the rows of the result in the same way as invoking {@link #next()} on
 * this object would, and that the {@link #close() close-method} on either iterator has the same effect. It is thus
 * safe to either close the projected column iterator, or this iterator, or both if all rows have not been consumed.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the {@link #next() iteration methods} on this interface, {@link #close()}, and the
 * {@link #columnAs(String) column projection method}, there are two methods for getting a string representation of the
 * result that also consumes the entire result if invoked. {@link #resultAsString()} returns a single string
 * representation of all (remaining) rows in the result, and {@link #writeAsStringTo(PrintWriter)} does the same, but
 * streams the result to the provided {@link PrintWriter} instead, without allocating large string objects.
 * <p>
 * The methods that do not consume any rows from the result, or in other ways alter the state of the result are safe to
 * invoke at any time, even after the result has been {@linkplain #close() closed} or fully exhausted. These methods
 * are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #columns()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getQueryStatistics()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getQueryExecutionType()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getExecutionPlanDescription()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Not all queries produce an actual result, and some queries that do might yield an empty result set. In order to
 * distinguish between these cases the {@link QueryExecutionType} {@linkplain #getQueryExecutionType() of this result}
 * can be queried.
