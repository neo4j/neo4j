 * These types of work must exhibit a number of properties, for their use in the WorkSync to be correct:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Commutativity</strong><br>
 * The order of operands must not matter:
 * <code>a.combine(b)  =  b.combine(a)</code>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Associativity</strong><br>
 * The order of operations must not matter:
 * <code>a.combine(b.combine(c))  =  a.combine(b).combine(c)</code>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Effect Transitivity</strong><br>
 * Work-combining must not change work outcome:
 * <code>a.combine(b).apply(m)  =  { a.apply(m) ; b.apply(m) }</code>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <Material> The type of material to work with.
 * @param <W> The concrete type of work being performed.
