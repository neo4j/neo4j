/**
 * Turns multi-threaded unary work into single-threaded stack work.
 * <p>
 * The technique used here is inspired in part both by the Flat Combining
 * concept from Hendler, Incze, Shavit &amp; Tzafrir, and in part by the
 * wait-free linked queue design by Vyukov.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a sense, this turns many small, presumably concurrent, pieces of work
 * into fewer, larger batches of work, that is then applied to the material
 * under synchronisation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Obviously this only makes sense for work that a) can be combined, and b)
 * where the performance improvements from batching effects is large enough
 * to overcome the overhead of collecting and batching up the work units.
