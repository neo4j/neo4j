/**
 * This is a concurrent data structure used to track
 * some set if boolean flags. Any time a flag is set to high,
 * it'll remain high for a period of time, after which
 * it'll fall back to low again. How long the flags stay high
 * depend on how often they are toggled - meaning this uses
 * both recency and frequency to determine which flags to keep
 * high.
 *
 * The more often a flag is toggled high, the longer it'll
 * take before it resets to low - if a flag gets set more
 * often than sweep is called, it will always be high.
 *
 * This data structure is coordination free, but sacrifices
 * accuracy for performance.
 *
 * Intended usage is that you'd have a set of keys you care
 * about, and set a max time where you'd like to mark a key
 * as low if that time passes; say 7 days.
 *
 * So, you'd set {@link #keepalive} to 7, and then you'd
 * schedule a thread to call {@link #sweep()} once per day.
 * Now, flags that were toggled once will be set to low again
 * the next day, while flags that were extensively used will
 * take up to seven days before falling back to low.
 *
 * Flags that are toggled at or more than once every day will
 * always be high.
