/**
 * {@code AsyncEvents} is a mechanism for queueing up events to be processed asynchronously in a background thread.
 *
 * The {@code AsyncEvents} object implements {@link Runnable}, so it can be passed to a thread pool, or given to a
 * dedicated thread. The runnable will then occupy a thread and dedicate it to background processing of events, until
 * the {@code AsyncEvents} is {@link AsyncEvents#shutdown()}.
 *
 * If events are sent to an {@code AsyncEvents} that has been shut down, then those events will be processed in the
 * foreground as a fall-back.
 *
 * Note, however, that no events are processed until the background thread is started.
 *
 * The {@code AsyncEvents} is given a {@link Consumer} of the specified event type upon construction, and will use it
 * for doing the actual processing of events once they have been collected.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of events the {@code AsyncEvents} will process.
