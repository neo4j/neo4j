/**
 * Table for storing and retrieving all entries managed by the {@link HopScotchHashingAlgorithm}.
 * A table is responsible for storing and retrieving:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>keys: a primitive long key</li>
 *   <li>hop bits: a concept used by the hop-scotch algorithm to manage hash conflicts, a.k.a. neighbor</li>
 *   <li>values: (OPTIONAL) value associated with each key. Optional in a setting where only the key is
 *       important, e.g. a set</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The {@link HopScotchHashingAlgorithm} contains all hashing logic and a {@link Table} is a dump, straight
 * forward data keeper. Optimizations for special keys or key/value combinations can be captured in
 * implementations of this. The only restriction is that keys must be decimal type numbers, f.ex. {@code short},
 * {@code int} or {@code long}. Where the key "carrier" between the algorithm and the table is always going to be
 * {@code long} since it can carry all the others.
