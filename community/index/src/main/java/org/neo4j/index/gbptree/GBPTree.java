/**
 * A generation-aware B+tree (GB+Tree) implementation directly atop a {@link PageCache} with no caching in between.
 * Additionally internal and leaf nodes on same level are linked both left and right (sibling pointers),
 * this to provide correct reading when concurrently {@link #writer() modifying}
 * the tree.
 * <p>
 * Generation is incremented on {@link Index#checkpoint(IOLimiter) check-pointing}.
 * Generation awareness allows for recovery from last {@link Index#checkpoint(IOLimiter)}, provided the same updates
 * will be replayed onto the index since that point in time.
 * <p>
 * Changes to tree nodes are made so that stable nodes (i.e. nodes that have survived at least one checkpoint)
 * are immutable w/ regards to keys values and child/sibling pointers.
 * Making a change in a stable node will copy the node to an unstable generation first and then make the change
 * in that unstable version. Further change in that node in the same generation will not require a copy since
 * it's already unstable.
 * <p>
 * Every pointer to another node (child/sibling pointer) consists of two pointers, one to a stable version and
 * one to a potentially unstable version. A stable -> unstable node copy will have its parent redirect one of its
 * two pointers to the new unstable version, redirecting readers and writers to the new unstable version,
 * while at the same time keeping one pointer to the stable version, in case there's a crash or non-clean
 * shutdown, followed by recovery.
 * <p>
 * Currently no leaves will be removed or merged as part of {@link IndexWriter#remove(Object) removals}.
 * <p>
 * A single writer w/ multiple concurrent readers is supported. Assuming usage adheres to this
 * constraint neither writer nor readers are blocking. Readers are virtually garbage-free.
 * <p>
 * An reader of GB+Tree is a {@link SeekCursor} that returns result as it finds them.
 * As the cursor move over keys/values, returned results are considered "behind" it
 * and likewise keys not yet returned "in front of".
 * Readers will always read latest written changes in front of it but will not see changes that appear behind.
 * The isolation level is thus read committed.
 * The tree have no knowledge about transactions and apply updates as isolated units of work one entry at the time.
 * Therefore, readers can see parts of transactions that are not fully applied yet.
 * <p>
 * A note on recovery:
 * <p>
 * {@link GBPTree} is designed to be able to handle non-clean shutdown / crash, but needs external help
 * in order to do so.
 * {@link #writer() Writes} happen to the tree and are made durable and
 * safe on next call to {@link #checkpoint(IOLimiter)}. Writes which happens after the last
 * {@link #checkpoint(IOLimiter)} are not safe if there's a {@link #close()} or JVM crash in between, i.e:
 *
 * <pre>
 * w: write
 * c: checkpoint
 * x: crash or {@link #close()}
 *
 * TIME |--w--w----w--c--ww--w-c-w--w-ww--w--w---x------|
 *         ^------ safe -----^   ^- unsafe --^
 * </pre>

 * The writes that happened before the last checkpoint are durable and safe, but the writes after it are not.
 * The tree can however get back to a consistent state by:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Creator of this tree detects that recovery is required (i.e. non-clean shutdown) and if so must call
 * {@link #prepareForRecovery()} ones, before any writes during recovery are made.</li>
 * <li>Replaying all the writes, exactly as they were made, since the last checkpoint all the way up
 * to the crash ({@code x}). Even including writes before the last checkpoint is OK, important is that
 * <strong>at least</strong> writes since last checkpoint are included.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Failure to follow the above steps will result in unknown state of the tree after a crash.
 * <p>
 * The reason as to why {@link #close()} doesn't do a checkpoint is that checkpointing as a whole should
 * be managed externally, keeping multiple resources in sync w/ regards to checkpoints.
