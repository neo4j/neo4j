 * PlanContext is an internal access layer to the graph that is solely used during plan building

 * As such it is similar to QueryContext. The reason for separating both interfaces is that we
 * want to control what operations can be executed at runtime.  For example, we do not give access
 * to index rule lookup in QueryContext as that should happen at query compile time.
