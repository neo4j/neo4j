/**
 * The relative costs of the different operators are estimated for graphs of some size, because no database user
 * will have graphs with <10 nodes. This means thought that applying these costs to single-digit graphs gives surprising
 * results, and plans that will be clearly suboptimal for larger graphs. This is mostly fine, as we force replanning
 * when the graph grows, but for large import queries this could have drastic performance impact in case the initial
 * import query gets stuck with a plan that becomes unusable towards the end of query invocation.
