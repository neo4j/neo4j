    * Performs DFS traversal, but omits traversing relationships that have been completely traversed (to the

    * Pruning and full expand depths
    * The full expand depth is an integer that denotes how deep a relationship has previously been explored. For
    * example, a full expand depth of 2 would mean that all nodes that can be reached by following this relationship
    * and maximally one more permitted relationship have already been visited. A relationship is permitted if is
    * conforms to the var-length predicates (which is controlled at expand time), and the relationship is not already
    * part of the current path.
    *
    * Before emitting a node (after relationship traversals), the PruningDFS updates the full expand depth of the
    * incoming relationship on the previous node in the path. The full expand depth is computed as
    * 1                 if the max path length is reached
    * A_VERY_BIG_VALUE  if the node has no relationships except the incoming one
    * d+1               otherwise, where d is the minimum outgoing full expand depth

    * @param path                     The path so far. Only the first pathLength elements are valid.
    * @param pathLength               Length of the path so far
    * @param state                    The QueryState
    * @param row                      The current row we are adding reachable nodes to
    * @param expandMap                maps NodeID -> FullExpandDepths

    *                                 incoming relationship in the previous node.
    *
    *                                 For this algorithm the incoming relationship is the one traversed to reach this
