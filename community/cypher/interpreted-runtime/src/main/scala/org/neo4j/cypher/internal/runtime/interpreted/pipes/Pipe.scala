/**
  * Pipe is a central part of Cypher. Most pipes are decorators - they
  * wrap another pipe. ParamPipe and NullPipe the only exception to this.
  * Pipes are combined to form an execution plan, and when iterated over,
  * the execute the query.
  *
  * ** WARNING **
  * Pipes are re-used between query executions, and must not hold state in instance fields.
  * Not heeding this warning will lead to bugs that do not manifest except for under concurrent use.
  * If you need to keep state per-query, have a look at QueryState instead.
