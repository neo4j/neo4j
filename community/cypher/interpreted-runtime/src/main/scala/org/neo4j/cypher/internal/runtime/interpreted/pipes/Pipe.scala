/**
 * Pipe is a central part of Cypher. Most pipes are decorators - they
 * wrap another pipe. ParamPipe and NullPipe the only exception to this.
 * Pipes are combined to form an execution plan, and when iterated over,
 * the execute the query.
 *
 * ** WARNING **
 * Pipes are re-used between query executions, and must not hold state in instance fields.
 * Not heeding this warning will lead to bugs that do not manifest except for under concurrent use.
 * If you need to keep state per-query, have a look at QueryState instead.
