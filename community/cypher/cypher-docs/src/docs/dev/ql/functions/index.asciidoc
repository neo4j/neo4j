Functions
=========

This chapter contains information on all functions in Cypher.
Note that related information exists in <<query-operators>>.

NOTE: Most functions in Cypher will return +null+ if the input parameter is +null+.

[[query-predicates]]
== Predicates ==

Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the +WHERE+ part of a query.

See also <<query-operators-comparison>>.

[[query-functions-collection]]
== Collection functions ==

Collection functions return collections of things -- nodes in a path, and so on.

[[query-functions-mathematical]]
== Mathematical functions ==

These functions all operate on numerical expressions only, and will return an error if used on any other values.

[[query-functions-string]]
== String functions ==

These functions all operate on string expressions only, and will return an error if used on any other values.
Except `STR()`, which converts to strings.
