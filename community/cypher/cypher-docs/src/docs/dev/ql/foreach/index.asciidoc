= Foreach =

Collections and paths are key concepts in Cypher.
To use them for updating data, you can use the `FOREACH` construct.
It allows you to do updating commands on elements in a collection -- a path, or a collection created by aggregation.

The identifier context inside of the foreach parenthesis is separate from the one outside it.
This means that  if you `CREATE` a node identifier inside of a `FOREACH`, you will _not_ be able to use it outside of the foreach statement, unless you match to find it.

Inside of the `FOREACH` parentheses, you can do any of the updating commands -- `CREATE`, `CREATE UNIQUE`, `DELETE`, and `FOREACH`.
