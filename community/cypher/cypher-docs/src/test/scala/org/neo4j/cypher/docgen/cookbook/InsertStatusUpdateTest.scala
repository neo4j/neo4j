Dividing the query into steps, this query resembles adding new item in middle of a doubly linked list:

. Get the latest update (if it exists) of the user through the `STATUS` relationship (`OPTIONAL MATCH (me)-[r:STATUS]-(secondlatestupdate)`).
. Delete the `STATUS` relationship between `user` and `secondlatestupdate` (if it exists), as this would become the second latest update now
  and only the latest update would be added through a `STATUS` relationship;
  all earlier updates would be connected to their subsequent updates through a `NEXT` relationship. (`DELETE r`).
. Now, create the new `statusupdate` node (with text and date as properties) and connect this with the user through a `STATUS` relationship
  (`CREATE me-[:STATUS]->(latest_update { text:'Status',date:123 })`).
. Pipe over `statusupdate` or an empty collection to the next query part
  (`WITH latest_update, collect(secondlatestupdate) AS seconds`).
. Now, create a `NEXT` relationship between the latest status update and the second latest status update (if it exists) (`FOREACH(x in seconds | CREATE latest_update-[:NEXT]->x)`).""",
