Collections
===========

Cypher has good support for collections.

== Collections in general ==    

A literal collection is created by using brackets and separating the elements in the collection with commas.

###
RETURN [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] as collection###

In our examples, we'll use the range function.
It gives you a collection containing all numbers between given start and end numbers.

To access individual elements in the collection, we use the square brackets again.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[3]###

You can also use negative numbers, to start from the end of the collection instead.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[-3]###

Finally, you can use ranges inside the brackets to return ranges of the collection.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[0..3]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[0..-5]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[-5..]###
###
RETURN range(0,10)[..4]###

Note: Out-of-bound slices are simply truncated, but out-of-bound single elements return null.

###
RETURN range(0,10)[15]###

###
RETURN range(0,10)[5..15]###

== List comprehension ==

List comprehension is a syntactic construct available in Cypher for creating a collection based on existing collections.
It follows the form of the mathematical set-builder notation (set comprehension) instead of the use of map
and filter functions.

###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 | x^3 ] AS result###

Either the +WHERE+ part, or the expression, can be omitted, if you only want to filter or map respectively.

###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) WHERE x % 2 = 0 ] AS result###
###
RETURN [x IN range(0,10) | x^3 ] AS result###


== Literal maps ==

From Cypher, you can also construct maps. Through REST you will get JSON objects; in Java they will be `java.util.Map<String,Object>`.

###
RETURN { key : "Value", collectionKey: [ { inner: "Map1" }, { inner: "Map2" } ] }###
