                       |This tutorial will show you how to import data from multiple CSV files using +LOAD CSV+.
                       |These files might be the result of exporting tables from a relational database and might
                       |contain explicit join keys.
                       |
                       |In this example, we'll use three files, one listing people, one listing movies and another one
                       |describing which movies have been directed by whom.
                       |All the rows in movies.csv and persons.csv will have an explicit primary key as you may expect
                       |in a relational database. The directors.csv mapping will consists of pairs of said keys.
                       |
                       |We'll use the following steps to import those three CSV files to the graph.
                       |
                       |Initially, we'll create indices for the id property on Person and Movie nodes. The id property
                       |will be a temporary property used to look up the appropriate nodes for a relationship when
                       |importing the third file. By creating an index, the +MATCH+ look ups will be much faster.
                       |
                       |###
                       |CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.id IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |###
                       |CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.id IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |
                       |First, we import the movies.csv file and create a Movie node for each row.
                       |
                       |###
                       |LOAD CSV FROM "file://$movies" AS csvLine
                       |CREATE (m:Movie {id: toInt(csvLine[0]), title: csvLine[1]})
                       |###
                       |
                       |Second, we do the same for the persons.csv file.
                       |
                       |###
                       |LOAD CSV FROM "file://$persons" AS csvLine
                       |CREATE (p:Person {id: toInt(csvLine[0]), name: csvLine[1]})
                       |###
                       |
                       |The last step is to create the relationships between nodes we've just created. Given a
                       |pair of two IDs, we look up the corresponding nodes and create a +DIRECTED+ relationship
                       |between them.
                       |
                       |###
                       |LOAD CSV FROM "file://$directors" AS csvLine
                       |MATCH (p:Person {id: toInt(csvLine[0])}), (m:Movie {id: csvLine[1]})
                       |CREATE (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
                       |###
                       |
                       |Finally, as the id property was only necessary to import the relationships, we can drop the
                       |constraints and the property from all nodes.
                       |
                       |###
                       |DROP CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.id IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |###
                       |DROP CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.id IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |###
                       |MATCH (n)
                       |REMOVE n.id
                       |###
                       |""".stripMargin
