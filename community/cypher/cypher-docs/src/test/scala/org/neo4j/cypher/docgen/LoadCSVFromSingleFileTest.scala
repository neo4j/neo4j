                       |This tutorial will show you how to import data from a single file using +LOAD CSV+.
                       |
                       |In this example, we're given a CSV file where each line contains a mapping of an actor, a movie
                       |they've played in and the role they were cast as in that movie.  Below we will assume that
                       |the CSV file has been stored on the database server and access it using a +file://+ URL.
                       |Alternatively, +LOADCSV+ also supports accessing CSV files via +HTTPS+, +HTTP+, and +FTP+.
                       |
                       |Using the following Cypher query, we'll create a node for each movie, a node for each actor and
                       |a relationship between the two with a property denoting the character name. We're using +MERGE+
                       |for creating the nodes so as to avoid creating duplicate nodes in the case where the same actor
                       |or movie appears in the file multiple times.
                       |
                       |If the input CSV file is big enough, a good way of speeding up the +MERGE+ commands is by
                       |creating two indices for Person nodes on the name property and Movies nodes on the title
                       |property before the +LOAD CSV+ command.
                       |
                       |###
                       |CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |###
                       |CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE
                       |###
                       |###
                       |LOAD CSV FROM "file://$roles" AS csvLine
                       |MERGE (p:Person {name: csvLine[0]})
                       |MERGE (m:Movie {title: csvLine[1]})
                       |CREATE (p)-[:PLAYED {role: csvLine[2]}]->(m)
                       |###
                       |
                       |+LOAD CSV+ also supports loading CSV files that start with headers (column names). In this
                       |case these header names may be used to address the values in a row via the
                       |+LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS+ clause.
