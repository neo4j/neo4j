Implementation of newsfeed or timeline feature is a frequent requirement for social applications. The following exmaples are inspired by http://techfin.in/2012/10/newsfeed-feature-powered-by-neo4j-graph-database/[Newsfeed feature powered by Neo4j Graph Database].
The query asked here is:
        
Starting at `me`, retrieve the time-ordered status feed of the status updates of me and and all friends that are connected via a `CONFIRMED` `FRIEND` relationship to me.""",
      queryText = """MATCH (me {name: 'Joe'})-[rels:FRIEND*0..1]-(myfriend)

"""
To understand the strategy, let's divide the query into five steps:

. First Get the list of all my friends (along with me) through `FRIEND` relationship (`MATCH (me {name: 'Joe'})-[rels:FRIEND*0..1]-(myfriend)`). Also,  the `WHERE` predicate can be added to check whether the friend request is pending or confirmed.
. Get the latest status update of my friends through Status relationship (`MATCH myfriend-[:STATUS]-latestupdate`).
. Get subsequent status updates (along with the latest one) of my friends through `NEXT` relationships (`MATCH (myfriend)-[:STATUS]-(latestupdate)-[:NEXT*0..1]-(statusupdates)`) which will give you the latest and one additional statusupdate; adjust `0..1` to whatever suits your case.
. Sort the status updates by posted date (`ORDER BY statusupdates.date DESC`).
. `LIMIT` the number of updates you need in every query (`LIMIT 3`).""",
