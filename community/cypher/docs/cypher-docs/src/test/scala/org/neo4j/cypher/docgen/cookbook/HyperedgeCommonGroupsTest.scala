5. +User2+ has +Role2+, +Role5+ in +Group1+; +Role3+, +Role4+ in +Group2+; +Role5+, +Role6+ in +Group3+ (hyper edges).

The graph for this looks like the following (nodes like +U1G2R23+ representing the HyperEdges):

.Graph
include::includes/cypher-hyperedgecommongroups-graph.asciidoc[]

To return +Group1+ and +Group2+ as +User1+ and +User2+ share at least one common role in these two groups, the query looks like this:
