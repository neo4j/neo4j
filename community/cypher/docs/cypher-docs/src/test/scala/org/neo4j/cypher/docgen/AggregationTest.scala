Aggregate functions take multiple input values and calculate an aggregated value from them.
Examples are +avg+ that calculates the average of multiple numeric values, or +min+ that finds the smallest numeric value in a set of values.

Aggregation can be done over all the matching sub graphs, or it can be further divided by introducing key values.
These are non-aggregate expressions, that are used to group the values going into the aggregate functions.

So, if the return statement looks something like this:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN n, count(*)
----

We have two return expressions -- `n`, and `count(*)`.
The first, `n`, is no aggregate function, and so it will be the grouping key.
The latter, `count(*)` is an aggregate expression.
So the matching subgraphs will be divided into different buckets, depending on the grouping key.
The aggregate function will then run on these buckets, calculating the aggregate values.

If you want to use aggregations to sort your result set, the aggregation must be included in the +RETURN+ to be used in your +ORDER BY+.

The last piece of the puzzle is the +DISTINCT+ keyword.
It is used to make all values unique before running them through an aggregate function.

An example might be helpful.
In this case, we are running the query against the following data:

include::includes/aggregation-introduction.preparation-graph.asciidoc[]

""",
      prepare = executePreparationQueries(List("""
MATCH (b:Person {name: 'B'}), (c:Person {name: 'C'})
CREATE (d:Person {name: 'D'}), (b)-[:KNOWS]->(d), (c)-[:KNOWS]->(d) 
""")),

        "WHERE me.name = 'A'" +
        "RETURN count(distinct friend_of_friend), count(friend_of_friend)",
      optionalResultExplanation = """
In this example we are trying to find all our friends of friends, and count them.
The first aggregate function, +count(DISTINCT friend_of_friend)+, will only see a `friend_of_friend` once -- +DISTINCT+ removes the duplicates.
The latter aggregate function, +count(friend_of_friend)+, might very well see the same `friend_of_friend` multiple times.
In this case, both +B+ and +C+ know +D+ and thus +D+ will get counted twice, when not using ++DISTINCT++.
