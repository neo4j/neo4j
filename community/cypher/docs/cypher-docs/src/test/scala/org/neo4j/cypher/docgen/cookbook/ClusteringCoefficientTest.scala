the graph in question is showing the 2-hop relationships of a sample person as nodes with `KNOWS` relationships.
        
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering coefficient] of a selected node is defined as the probability that two randomly selected neighbors are connected to each other. 
With the number of neighbors as `n` and the number of mutual connections between the neighbors `r` the calculation is:

The number of possible connections between two neighbors is `n!/(2!(n-2)!) = 4!/(2!(4-2)!) = 24/4 = 6`,
where `n` is the number of neighbors `n = 4` and the actual number `r` of connections is `1`. 
Therefore the clustering coefficient of node 1 is `1/6`.
        
`n` and `r` are quite simple to retrieve via the following query:""",
