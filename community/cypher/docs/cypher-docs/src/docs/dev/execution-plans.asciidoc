= Execution Plans =

Cypher is a declarative query language.
That means that a statement describes what should be done, and not how to actually do it.
To actually be able to run a query, it needs to be transformed to an imperative solution for the statement.
This solution is called an execution plan.
An execution plan is a tree composed of operators, each non-leaf feeding from one or two children.
To analyze a query for performance improvements, it's essential to be able to understand how Neo4j is running your Cypher statements.

These are some of the operators you will see if you look at execution plans.
