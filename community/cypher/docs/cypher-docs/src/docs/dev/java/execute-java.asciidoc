= Execute Cypher Queries from Java =

[TIP]
The full source code of the example:
https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/{neo4j-git-tag}/community/cypher/cypher-docs/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java[JavaQuery.java]

In Java, you can use the <<cypher-query-lang,Cypher query language>> as per the example below.
First, let's add some data.

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-cypher-docs
source=org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java
tag=addData
classifier=test-sources
----

Execute a query:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-cypher-docs
source=org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java
tag=execute
classifier=test-sources
----

NOTE: Keep the +ExecutionEngine+ around, don't create a new one for each query!

The result will be:

include::java-cypher-queries-result.asciidoc[]

CAUTION: The classes used here are from the +org.neo4j.cypher.javacompat+ package, _not_ +org.neo4j.cypher+, see link to the Java API below.

You can get a list of the columns in the result:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-cypher-docs
source=org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java
tag=columns
classifier=test-sources
----

This contains:

include::java-cypher-queries-columns.asciidoc[]

To fetch the result items from a single column, do like this:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-cypher-docs
source=org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java
tag=items
classifier=test-sources
----

In this case there's only one node in the result:

include::java-cypher-queries-node.asciidoc[]

To get all columns, do like this instead:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-cypher-docs
source=org/neo4j/cypher/javacompat/JavaQuery.java
tag=rows
classifier=test-sources
----

This outputs:

include::java-cypher-queries-rows.asciidoc[]

CAUTION: +dumpToString()+, +columnAs()+ and +iterator()+ cannot be called more than once on the same ExecutionResult object. You should instead use only one and if you need the facilities of the other methods on the same query result instead create a new ExecutionResult.

CAUTION: When using an ExecutionResult, you'll need to exhaust it by using any of the iterating methods (+columnAs()+ and +iterator()+) on it. Failing to do so will not properly clean up resources used by the ExecutionResult, leading to unwanted behavior, such as leaking transactions.
