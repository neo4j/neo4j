[[query-remove]]
= Remove

[abstract]
The `REMOVE` clause is used to remove properties and labels from graph elements.

For deleting nodes and relationships, see <<query-delete>>.

[NOTE]
Removing labels from a node is an idempotent operation:
If you try to remove a label from a node that does not have that label on it, nothing happens.
The query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not.

The examples start out with the following database:

include::includes/cypher-remove-graph.asciidoc[]

:leveloffset: 2

include::remove-a-property.asciidoc[]

include::remove-a-label-from-a-node.asciidoc[]
