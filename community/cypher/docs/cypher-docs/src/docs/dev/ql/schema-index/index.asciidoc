Indexes
=======

Cypher allows the creation of indexes over a property for all nodes that have a given label.
These indexes are automatically managed and kept up to date by the database whenever the graph is changed.
The index creation command supports the creation of various types of indexes, but in the current version
of Neo4j only the +SIMPLE+ type is supported. This provides the ability to perform exact match queries on
node _label + property + value_ combinations. Other indexes may be supported in future.

[NOTE]
You cannot create more than one index on the same label/property combination.
