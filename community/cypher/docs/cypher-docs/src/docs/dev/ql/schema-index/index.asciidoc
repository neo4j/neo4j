= Indexes

A database index is a redundant copy of information in the database for the purpose of making retrieving said data more efficient.
This comes at the cost of additional storage space and slower writes.

Cypher allows the creation of indexes over a property for all nodes that have a given label.
These indexes are automatically managed and kept up to date by the database whenever the graph is changed.
