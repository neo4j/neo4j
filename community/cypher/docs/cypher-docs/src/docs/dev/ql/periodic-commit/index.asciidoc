Using Periodic Commit
=====================

NOTE: See <<cypherdoc-importing-csv-files-with-cypher>> on how to import data from CSV files.

Updating very large amounts of data (e.g. when importing) with a single Cypher query may fail due to memory constraints.
For these situations *only*, Cypher provides the global +USING PERIODIC COMMIT+ query hint for updating queries.

Periodic Commit will process the rows until the number of rows reaches a limit.
Then the current transaction will be committed and replaced with a newly opened transaction.
If no limit is set, a default value will be used.

See <<load-csv-importing-large-amounts-of-data>> in <<query-load-csv>> for examples of +USING PERIODIC COMMIT+ with and without setting the number of rows per commit.

[IMPORTANT]
Using periodic commit will prevent running out of memory when updating large amounts of data.
However it will also break transactional isolation thus it should only be used where needed.
