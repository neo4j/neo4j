[[query-start]]
= Start

[abstract]
Find starting points through legacy indexes.

[IMPORTANT]
The `START` clause should only be used when accessing legacy indexes (see <<indexing>>).
In all other cases, use `MATCH` instead (see <<query-match>>).

In Cypher, every query describes a pattern, and in that pattern one can have multiple starting points.
A starting point is a relationship or a node where a pattern is anchored.
Using `START` you can only introduce starting points by legacy index lookups.
Note that trying to use a legacy index that doesn't exist will generate an error.

This is the graph the examples are using:
