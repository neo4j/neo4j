[[query-start]]
Start
=====

[IMPORTANT]
The +START+ clause should only be used when accessing legacy indexes (see <<indexing>>).
In all other cases, use +MATCH+ instead (see <<query-match>>).
 
Every query describes a pattern, and in that pattern one can have multiple starting points.
A starting point is a relationship or a node where a pattern is anchored.
You can only introduce starting points by legacy index lookups.
Note that trying to use a legacy index that doesn't exist will generate an error.

[NOTE]
The +START+ clause is only really needed when using legacy indexes.
If you do not specify explicit starting points, Cypher will infer starting points from your query.
This is done based on node labels and predicates contained in the query.
See <<cypher-schema>> for more information.

This is the graph the examples are using:
