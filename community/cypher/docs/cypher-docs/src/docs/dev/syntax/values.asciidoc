Values
======

All values that are handled by Cypher have a distinct type.
The supported types of values are:

* Numeric values,
* String values,
* Boolean values,
* Nodes,
* Relationships,
* Paths,
* Maps from Strings to other values,
* Collections of any other type of value.

Most types of values can be constructed in a query using literal expressions (see <<cypher-expressions>>).
Special care must be taken when using `NULL`, as `NULL` is a value of every type (see <<cypher-working-with-null>>).
Nodes, relationships, and paths are returned as a result of pattern matching.

Note that labels are not values but are a form of pattern syntax.
