Accessing entities by id via +START+
====================================

In versions of Cypher prior to 2.2 it was also possible to access specific nodes or relationships using the +START+ clause. In this case you could use a syntax like the following:

[source,cypher]
----
CYPHER 2.1
START n=node(42)
RETURN n
----

[NOTE]
The use of the +START+ clause to find nodes by ID was deprecated from Cypher 2.0 onwards and is now entirely disabled in Cypher 2.2 and up.
You should instead make use of the +MATCH+ clause for starting points.
See <<query-match>> for more information on the correct syntax for this.
The +START+ clause should only be used when accessing legacy indexes (see <<indexing>>).
