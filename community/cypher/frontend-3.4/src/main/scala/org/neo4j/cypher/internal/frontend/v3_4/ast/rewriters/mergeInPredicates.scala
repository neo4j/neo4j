/**
  * Merges multiple IN predicates into one.
  *
  * Examples:
  * MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop IN [1,2,3] AND [2,3,4] RETURN n.prop
  * => MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop IN [2,3]
  *
  * MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop IN [1,2,3] OR [2,3,4] RETURN n.prop
  * => MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop IN [1,2,3,4]

  * MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop IN [1,2,3] AND [4,5,6] RETURN n.prop
  * => MATCH (n) WHERE FALSE

  * NOTE: this rewriter must be applied before auto parameterization, since after
  * that we are just dealing with opaque parameters.
