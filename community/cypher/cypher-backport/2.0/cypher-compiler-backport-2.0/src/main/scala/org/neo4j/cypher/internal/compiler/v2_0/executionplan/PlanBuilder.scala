/*
PlanBuilders are basically partial functions that can execute for some input, and can answer if an
input is something it can work on.

The idea is that they take an ExecutionPlanInProgress, and moves it a little bit towards a more solved plan, which is
represented by the stack of Pipes.

A PlanBuilder should only concern itself with the first PartiallySolvedQuery part - the tail query parts will be seen
later.

It's important that PlanBuilders never return the input unchanged.
