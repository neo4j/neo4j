/*
The work done here is non-trivial, so I'll try to explain it in English.

For this return-clause:
  RETURN m, head(collect(n.x)), last(collect(n.x))

we have to take the following steps.

Step 1:
Calculate and save to the execution context the values of the keys and aggregate expressions, in this case:
Key: m
Aggregation: collect(n.x)

The aggregation result will be saved under a random key, so it can be used to sort and calculate compound expressions.

Step 2:
Rewrite the remainder of the query to not use the aggregation expression, instead now using the key to the aggregation
value.
