RollUp is the inverse of the Unwind operator. For each row passed in from the LHS, the whole RHS is executed.
For each row produced by the RHS, a single column value is extracted and inserted into a collection.

It is used for sub queries that return collections, such as pattern expressions (returns a collection of paths) and
pattern comprehension.

Note about nullableIdentifiers: when any of these identifiers is null, the collection should be null.
