/*
Triadic selection is used to solve a common query pattern:
MATCH (a)-->(b)-->(c) WHERE NOT (a)-->(c)

If this query can be solved by starting from (a) and expand first (a)-->(b)
and expanding (b)-->(c), we can repalce the filter with a triadic selection
that runs the (a)-->(b) as its left hand side, caching the results for use in
filtering the results of its right hand side which is the (b)-->(c) expands.
The filtering is based on the pattern expression predicate. The classical
example is the friend of a friend that is not already a friend, as shown above,
but this works for other cases too, like fof that is a friend.

Since the two expands are done by sub-plans, they can be substantially more
complex than single expands. However, what patterns actually get here need to
be identified by the triadic selection finder.

In effect the triadic selection interprets the predicate pattern in:
    MATCH (<source>){-->(build)}{-->(target)}
    WHERE NOT (<source>)-->(<target>)

as the predicate:

    WHERE (<target>) NOT IN Set(<build>, for <source>)

With a plan that looks like:

+TriadicSelection (c) NOT IN (b)
| \
| +<target>       (b)-->(c)
| |
| +Argument       (b)
|
+<build>          (a)-->(b)
|
+<source>         (a)
