/*
This class ties together disparate query graphs through their event horizons. It does so by using Apply,
which in most cases is then rewritten away by LogicalPlan rewriting.

In cases where the preceding PlannerQuery has updates we must make the Apply an EagerApply if there
are overlaps between the previous update and the reads of any of the tails. We must also make Reads
in the tail into RepeatableReads if there is overlap between the read and update within the PlannerQuery.

For example:

    +Apply2
    |\
    | +Update3
    | |
    | +Read3
    |
    +Apply1
    |\
    | +Update2
    | |
    | +Read2
    |
    +Update1
    |
    +Read1

In this case the following must hold
  - Apply1 is eager if updates from Update1 will be matched by Reads2 or Reads3.
  - Apply2 is eager if updates from Update2 will be matched by Reads3
  - If Update2 affects Read2, Read2 must use RepeatableRead
  - If Update3 affects Read3, Read2 must use RepeatableRead
