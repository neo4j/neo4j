/*
A LogicalPlan is an algebraic query, which is represented by a query tree whose leaves are database relations and
non-leaf nodes are algebraic operators like selections, projections, and joins. An intermediate node indicates the
application of the corresponding operator on the relations generated by its children, the result of which is then sent
further up. Thus, the edges of a tree represent data flow from bottom to top, i.e., from the leaves, which correspond
to data in the database, to the root, which is the final operator producing the query answer. */
