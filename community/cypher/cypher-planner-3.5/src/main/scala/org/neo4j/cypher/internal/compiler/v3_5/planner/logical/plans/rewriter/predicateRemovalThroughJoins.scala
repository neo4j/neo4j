/*
A join on given variable is similar to a logical AND - any predicates evaluated on the LHS will in effect
also be applied to the output of the join. This means that evaluating the same predicate on the RHS is redundant.

This rewriters finds predicates on the join variables, and removes any predicates on the RHS that already
exist on the LHS.
