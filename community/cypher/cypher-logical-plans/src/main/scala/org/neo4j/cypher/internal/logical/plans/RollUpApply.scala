 * RollUp is the inverse of the Unwind operator. For each left row,
 * right is executed. For each right row produced, a single column value
 * is extracted and inserted into a collection. which is assigned to 'collectionName'.
 * The left row is produced.
 *
 * It is used for sub queries that return collections, such as pattern expressions (returns
 * a collection of paths) and pattern comprehension.
 *
 * Note about nullableIdentifiers: when any of these identifiers are null, the collection
 * should be null.
