Identifiers
===========

When you reference parts of the pattern, you do so by naming them. The names you give the different parts are
calles identifiers.

In this example:

+START n=node(1) MATCH n`-->`b RETURN b+

The identifiers are +n+ and +b+.

Identifiers can be lower or upper case, and may contain underscore.
If other characters are needed, you can use the +`+ sign.
The same rules apply to property names.
