Cypher Query Language
=====================

A new query language, code-named ``Cypher'', has been added to Neo4j.
It allows for expressive and efficient querying of the graph store without having to write traversers in code.
Cypher is still growing and maturing, and that means that there probably will be breaking syntax changes.
It also means that it has not undergone the same rigorous performance testing as the other components.

Cypher is designed to be a humane query language, suitable for both 
developers and (importantly, we think) operations professionals who 
want to make ad-hoc queries on the database. Its constructs are based 
on English prose and neat iconography, which helps to make it (somewhat) 
self-explanatory.

Cypher is inspired by a number of different approaches and builds upon
established practices for expressive querying. Most of the keywords like
+WHERE+ and +ORDER BY+ are inspired by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL[SQL].
Pattern matching borrows expression approaches from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL[SPARQL].
Regular expression matching is implemented using the http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala programming language].

Cypher is a declarative language. It focuses on the clarity of expressing _what_
to retrieve from a graph, not _how_ to do it, in contrast to imperative languages like Java,
and scripting languages like http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] (supported via the <<gremlin-plugin>>) 
and http://neo4j.rubyforge.org/[the JRuby Neo4j bindings]. This makes the concern of how to optimize
queries in implementation detail not exposed to the user.

The query language is comprised of several distinct parts.

* +START+: Starting points in the graph, obtained by element IDs or via index lookups

* +MATCH+: The graph pattern to match, bound to the starting points in +START+

* +WHERE+: Filtering criteria

* +RETURN+: What to return

Let's see three of them in action:

In Java, using the query language looks something like this:

[[cypher-parameters]]
== Parameters ==

Cypher supports querying with parameters. This allows developers to not to have to do string building
to create a query, and it also makes caching of execution plans much easier for Cypher.

Parameters can be used for literals in the +WHERE+ clause, for the index key and index value in the +START+
clause, index queries, and finally for node/relationship ids.

Accepted names for parameter are letters and number, and any combination of these.


Here follows a few examples of how you can use parameters from Java.

[[cypher-identifiers]]
== Identifiers ==

When you reference parts of the pattern, you do so by naming them.

Identifiers can be lower or upper case, and may contain underscore.
If other characters are needed, you can use the +`+ sign.
The same rules apply to property names.
