[[query-relate]]
Relate
======
+RELATE+ is in the middle of +MATCH+ and +CREATE+ -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing. +RELATE+
will always make the least change possible to the graph -- if it can use parts of the existing graph, it will.

Another difference to +MATCH+ is that +RELATE+ assumes the pattern to be unique. If multiple matching subgraphs are
found an exception will be thrown.

[TIP]
In the `RELATE` clause, patterns are used a lot.
Read <<introduction-pattern>> for an introduction.
