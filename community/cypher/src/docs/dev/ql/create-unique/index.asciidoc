Create Unique
=============
+CREATE UNIQUE+ is in the middle of +MATCH+ and +CREATE+ -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing.
+CREATE UNIQUE+ will always make the least change possible to the graph -- if it can use parts of the existing graph,
it will.

Another difference to +MATCH+ is that +CREATE UNIQUE+ assumes the pattern to be unique. If multiple matching subgraphs
are found an exception will be thrown.

[TIP]
In the +CREATE UNIQUE+ clause, patterns are used a lot.
Read <<introduction-pattern>> for an introduction.
