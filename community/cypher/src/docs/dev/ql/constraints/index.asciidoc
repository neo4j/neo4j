Constraints
===========

Neo4j helps enforcing data integrity with the use of constraints.

You can use unique constraints to ensure that property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label.
Unique constraints do not mean that all nodes have to have a unique value for the properties -- nodes without the property are not subject to this rule.

Remember that adding constraints is an atomic operation that can take a while -- all existing data has to be scanned before Neo4j can turn the constraint ``on''.

You can have multiple unique constraints for a given label.
