Constraints
===========

[WARNING]
This feature is currently in active development, and is not guaranteed to work properly until this message is removed.

Neo4j helps enforce data integrity with the use of constraints.

You can use unique constraints to ensure that property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label.
Unique constraints do not mean that all nodes have to have a unique value for the properties -- nodes without the property are not subject to this rule.

Remember that adding constraints is an atomic operation that can take a while -- all existing data has to be scanned before Neo4j can turn the constraint ``on''.

You can have multiple unique constraints for a given label.
