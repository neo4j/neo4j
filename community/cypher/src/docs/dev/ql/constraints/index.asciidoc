Constraints
===========

Neo4j helps enforcing data integrity with the use of constraints.

You can use unique constraints to ensure that property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label.
Unique constraints do not mean that all nodes have to have a unique value for properties - nodes without the property
are not subject to this rule.

Remember that adding constraints is an atomic operation that can take a while - all existing data has to be scanned
before Neo4j can turn the constraint "on".

You can have multiple unique constraints for a given label.
