Functions
=========
Most functions in Cypher will return +null+ if the input parameter is +null+.

Here is a list of the functions in Cypher, seperated into three different sections: Predicates, Scalar functions and Aggregated functions

== Predicates ==
Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the +WHERE+ part of a query.
