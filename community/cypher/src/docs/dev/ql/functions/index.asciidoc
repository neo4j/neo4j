Functions
=========
Most functions in Cypher will return +null+ if the input parameter is +null+.

Here is a list of the functions in Cypher, seperated into three different sections: Predicates, Scalar functions and Aggregated functions

== Predicates ==
Predicates are boolean functions that return true or false for a given set of input.
They are most commonly used to filter out subgraphs in the +WHERE+ part of a query.

include::any.asciidoc[]

include::none.asciidoc[]

include::single.asciidoc[]

:leveloffset: 2

== Scalar functions ==
Scalar functions return a single value.

include::length.asciidoc[]

include::type.asciidoc[]

include::id.asciidoc[]

include::coalesce.asciidoc[]

== Collection functions ==
Collection functions return collections of things -- nodes in a path, and so on.

include::filter.asciidoc[]

include::tail.asciidoc[]

include::range.asciidoc[]

include::reduce.asciidoc[]

:leveloffset: 2

== Mathematical functions ==
These functions all operate on numerical expressions only, and will return an
error if used on any other values.

:leveloffset: 3

include::abs.asciidoc[]

include::round.asciidoc[]

include::sqrt.asciidoc[]

include::sign.asciidoc[]

== String functions ==
These functions all operate on string expressions only, and will return an
error if used on any other values. Except STR(), which converts to strings.
