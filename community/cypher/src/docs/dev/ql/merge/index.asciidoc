Merge
=====

== Introduction ==
+MERGE+ either matches existing nodes and binds them, or it creates new data and binds that. For example, you can
search for a user node by id, and if the node does not already exist in the database, it will create it.

+MERGE+ is not only used for single nodes - just like +MATCH+, if multiple nodes match, they will all be
bound to the identifier.

The following graph is used for the examples below:
