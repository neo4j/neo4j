[[query-with]]
With
====
The ability to chain queries together allows for powerful constructs. In Cypher, the +WITH+ clause is
used to pipe the result from one query to the next.

+WITH+ is also used to separate reading from updating of the graph. Every sub-query of a query must be either
read-only or write-only.
