Foreach
=======
Collections and paths are key concepts in Cypher. To use them for updating data, you can use the `FOREACH` construct.
It allows you to do updating commands on elements in a collection -- a path, or a collection created by aggregation.

The identifier context inside of the foreach parenthesis is separate from the one outside it, i.e. if you `CREATE` a
node identifier inside of a `FOREACH`, you will not be able to use it outside of the foreach statement, unless you
match to find it.

Inside of the `FOREACH` parenthesis, you can do any updating commands -- `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `RELATE`, and `FOREACH`.
