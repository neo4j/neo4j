== Hyperedges and Cypher ==

Imagine a user being part of different groups. A group can have different roles, and a 
user can be part of different groups. He also can have 
different roles in different groups apart from the membership. The
association of a User, a Group and a Role can be referred to as a
_HyperEdge_. However, it can be easily modeled in a property graph as a
node that captures this n-ary relationship, as depicted below in the
+U1G2R1+ node.
