Start
=====

Every query describes a pattern, and in that pattern one can have multiple
starting points. A starting point is a relationship or a node where a pattern is anchored.
You can either introduce starting points by id, or by
index lookups. Note that trying to use an index that doesn't exist will throw
an exception.
