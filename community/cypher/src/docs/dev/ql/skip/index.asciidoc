[[query-skip]]
Skip
====

+SKIP+ enables the return of only subsets of the total result.
By using +SKIP+, the result set will get trimmed from the top.
Please note that no guarantees are made on the order of the result unless the query specifies the +ORDER BY+ clause.

Note that +SKIP+ always works on the result, i.e. updates are done on all the matching items, not just
the ones returned from the query.
