Remove
======
Removing properties and labels from graph elements is done using +REMOVE+.

NOTE: Removing labels from a node is an idempotent operation - if you try to remove a label from a node that does not have that label on it, nothing happens. The
query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not.

The examples start out with the following database:

include::includes/cypher-remove-graph.asciidoc[]

:leveloffset: 2

include::remove-a-property.asciidoc[]

include::remove-a-label-from-a-node.asciidoc[]

include::removing-multiple-labels.asciidoc[]
