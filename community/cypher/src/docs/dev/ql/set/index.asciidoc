[[query-set]]
Set
===
Updating properties and labels on nodes and relationships is done with the +SET+ clause.
+SET+ properties can also be used with maps from parameters.

NOTE: Setting labels on a node is an idempotent operations - if you try to set a label on a node that already has that label on it, nothing happens. The
query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not.

The examples use this graph as a starting point:
