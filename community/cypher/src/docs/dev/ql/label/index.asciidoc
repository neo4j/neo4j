Adding and removing labels
==========================

Adding labels to nodes is done with the +ADD+ +LABEL+ clause. To remove them, use the +REMOVE+ +LABEL+.

When using only literal labels, you can omit the +LABEL+ part. Adding and removing labels are idempotent
operations - if you try to add a label to a node that already has that label on it, nothing happens. The
query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not. The same thing goes for removing
labels - removing a label that's not set on a node is a no-op.
