Linked Lists
============

A powerful feature of using a graph database, is that you can create your own in-graph data structures -- like a linked
list.

This datastructure uses a single node as the list reference. The reference has an outgoing relationship to the head of
the list, and an incoming relationship from the last element of the list. If the list is empty, the reference will point
to it self.

Something like this:

###graph-image graph [rankdir=RL]###

To initialize an empty linked list, we simply create an empty node, and make it link to itself.

###no-results empty-graph assertion=create
CREATE root-[:LINK]->root // no ‘value’ property assigned to root
RETURN root###


Adding values is done by finding the relationship where the new value should be placed in, and replacing it with
a new node, and two relationships to it.

###no-results assertion=add
START root=node:node_auto_index(name = "ROOT")
MATCH root-[:LINK*0..]->before,// before could be same as root
      after-[:LINK*0..]->root, // after could be same as root
      before-[old:LINK]->after
WHERE before.value? < 25  // This is the value, which would normally
  AND 25 < after.value?   // be supplied through a parameter.
CREATE before-[:LINK]->({value:25})-[:LINK]->after
DELETE old###

Deleting a value, conversely, is done by finding the node with the value, and the two relationships going in and out
from it, and replacing with a new value.

###no-results assertion=delete
START root=node:node_auto_index(name = "ROOT")
MATCH root-[:LINK*0..]->before,
      before-[delBefore:LINK]->del-[delAfter:LINK]->after,
      after-[:LINK*0..]->root
WHERE del.value! = 10
CREATE before-[:LINK]->after
DELETE del, delBefore, delAfter###
