/*
This test tries to set up a situation where CREATE UNIQUE would fail, unless we guard with locks to prevent creating
multiple relationships.

It does so by using a decorator around ImpermanentGraphDatabase, so directly after CREATE UNIQUE has done
getRelationships on a node, we'll create a new relationship.
