Identifiers
===========

When you reference parts of the pattern, you do so by naming them.
The names you give the different parts are called identifiers.

In this example:

[source,cypher]
----
START n=node(1) MATCH n-->b RETURN b
----

The identifiers are +n+ and +b+.

Identifier names are case sensitive, and can contain underscores and alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), but must
start with a letter. If other characters are needed, you can quote the identifier using backquote (+`+) signs.

The same rules apply to property names.
