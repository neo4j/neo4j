[[query-where]]
Where
=====

+WHERE+ is not a clause in it's own right - rather, it's part of +MATCH+, +OPTIONAL+ +MATCH+, +START+ and +WITH+.

In the case of +WITH+ and +START+, +WHERE+ simply filters the results.

For +MATCH+ and +OPTIONAL+ +MATCH+ on the other hand, +WHERE+ adds constraints to the patterns described. It should
not be seen as a filter after the matching is finished.
