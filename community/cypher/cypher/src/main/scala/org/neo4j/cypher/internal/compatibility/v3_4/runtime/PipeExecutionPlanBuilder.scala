  Traverses the logical plan tree structure and builds up the corresponding pipe structure. Given a logical plan such as:

          a
         / \
        b   c
       /   / \
      d   e   f

   populate(a) starts the session, and eagerly adds [a, c, f] to the plan stack. We then immediately pop 'f' from the
   plan stack, we build a pipe for it add it to the pipe stack, and pop 'c' from the plan stack. Since we are coming from
   'f', we add [c, e] to the stack and then pop 'e' out again. This is a leaf, so we build a pipe for it and add it to the
   pipe stack. We now pop 'c' from the plan stack again. This time we are coming from 'e', and so we know we can use
   two pipes from the pipe stack to use when building 'c'. We add this pipe to the pipe stack and pop 'a' from the plan
   stack. Since we are coming from 'a's RHS, we add [a,b,d] to the stack. Next step is to pop 'd' out, and build a pipe
   for it, storing it in the pipe stack. Pop ut 'b' from the plan stack, one pipe from the pipe stack, and build a pipe for 'b'.
   Next we pop out 'a', and this time we are coming from the LHS, and we can now pop two pipes from the pipe stack to
   build the pipe for 'a'. Thanks for reading this far - I didn't think we would make it!
