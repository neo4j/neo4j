--------------------
o Added literal collections and the IN predicate
o Added HEAD, TAIL, LAST and FILTER
o Added comments
o Added ! so that missing property can evaluate to false
o The column names are now exactly as written in the RETURN expression
o BREAKING CHANGE: To check whether a property exists on a node, use the HAS(...) function
o Arithmetic & string concatenation
o An identifier can now be assigned all the nodes/rels in the graph - START a=node(*)
o Predicates can be specified inside of a pattern relationship description
o Fixed issues #196, #164, #193, #217, #214, #201, #198, #240, #254

1.6 (2012-01-19)
----------------
o Lots of changes to the parsers error reporting
o Queries can now be pre-pended with which parser version to use
o Database configuration can now change which version of the parser to use as default

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)
--------------------
o Added a different aggregation logic. Makes aggregating on the same columns as sorting much faster
o Made it possible to query on array properties
o Fixed bug #157 - Comparing things of different types now gives false instead of type error
o Fixed bug #140 - Identifier can now named same thing as a parameter
o Fixed bug that tripped up the patter matchern when a node is sent in as a parameter
o Fixed bug #168 - Ordering on renamed columns now works well
o Fixed bug #170 - Arrays are now pretty-printed instead of Array.toString

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o Added allShortestPaths
o Added COALESCE
o Added column aliasing with AS
o Variable length relationships can now introduce a rel-iterable
o BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the syntax for iterable predicated ALL/NONE/ANY/SINGLE to use WHERE instead of a colon
o BREAKING CHANGE: ExecutionResult is now a read-once, forward only iterator. 
o Fixed problems with optional graph elements

1.6.M01 (2011-11-24)
--------------------
o Made zero length (a single node) paths possible
o Skip, limit and regular expressions can now be parameterized
o Column order is now preserved
o Distinct and order by can now be used at the same time
o Paths can now be optional
o Execution plans can now be pretty printed
o Solved a bug when using multiple regular expressions in the same query
o Added the extract function

1.5 (2011-10-18)
----------------
o Added DISTINCT for all aggregate functions
o Nodes/relationships can be parameters as well

1.5.M02 (2011-10-10)
--------------------
o Relationships can now be optional
o Added new predicated for iterables: ALL/ANY/NONE/SINGLE
o Added path functions: NODES/RELATIONSHIPS/LENGTH
o Parameters for literals, index queries and node/relationship id
o Shortest path added
o Pattern matcher will, if possible, eliminate subgraphs early, by using the predicates from the WHERE clause
o Relationships can be bound now
o Added IS NULL for NULL checking
o Added new aggregate function - COLLECT

1.5.M01 (2011-08-31)
