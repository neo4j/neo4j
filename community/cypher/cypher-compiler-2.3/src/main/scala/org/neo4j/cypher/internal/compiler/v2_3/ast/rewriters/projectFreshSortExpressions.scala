/**
 * This rewriter ensures that WITH clauses containing a ORDER BY or WHERE are split, such that the ORDER BY or WHERE does not
 * refer to any newly introduced identifier.
 *
 * This is required due to constraints in the planner. Note that this structure is invalid for semantic checking, which requires
 * that ORDER BY and WHERE _only refer to identifiers introduced in the associated WITH_.
 *
 * Additionally, it splits RETURN clauses containing ORDER BY. This would typically be done earlier during normalizeReturnClauses, however
 * "RETURN * ORDER BY" is not handled at that stage, due to lacking identifier information. If expandStar has already been run, then this
 * will now work as expected.
