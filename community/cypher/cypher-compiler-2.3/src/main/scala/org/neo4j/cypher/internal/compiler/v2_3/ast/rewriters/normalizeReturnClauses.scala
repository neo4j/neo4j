/**
 * This rewriter makes sure that all return items in a RETURN clauses are aliased, and moves
 * any ORDER BY to a preceding WITH clause
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * MATCH (n)
 * RETURN n.foo AS foo, n.bar ORDER BY foo
 *
 * This rewrite will change the query to:
 *
 * MATCH (n)
 * WITH n.foo AS `  FRESHIDxx`, n.bar AS `  FRESHIDnn` ORDER BY `  FRESHIDxx`
 * RETURN `  FRESHIDxx` AS foo, `  FRESHIDnn` AS `n.bar`
