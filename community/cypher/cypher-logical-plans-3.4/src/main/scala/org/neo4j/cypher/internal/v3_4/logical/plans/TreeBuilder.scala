  /*
Traverses the logical plan tree structure and builds up the corresponding output structure. Given a logical plan such as:

        a
       / \
      b   c
     /   / \
    d   e   f

 populate(a) starts the session, and eagerly adds [a, c, f] to the plan stack. We then immediately pop 'f' from the
 plan stack, we build an output for it add it to the output stack, and pop 'c' from the plan stack. Since we are coming from
 'f', we add [c, e] to the stack and then pop 'e' out again. This is a leaf, so we build an output for it and add it to the
 output stack. We now pop 'c' from the plan stack again. This time we are coming from 'e', and so we know we can use
 two outputs from the output stack to use when building 'c'. We add this output to the output stack and pop 'a' from the plan
 stack. Since we are coming from 'a's RHS, we add [a,b,d] to the stack. Next step is to pop 'd' out, and build an output
 for it, storing it in the output stack. Pop ut 'b' from the plan stack, one output from the output stack, and build an output for 'b'.
 Next we pop out 'a', and this time we are coming from the LHS, and we can now pop two outputs from the output stack to
 build the output for 'a'. Thanks for reading this far - I didn't think we would make it!
