/*
 * Developer note: This is an attempt at an internal graph database API, which defines a clean cut between
 * two layers, the query engine layer and, for lack of a better name, the core database layer.
 *
 * Building the query engine layer on top of an internal layer means we can move much faster, not
 * having to worry about deprecations and so on. It is also acceptable if this layer is a bit clunkier, in this
 * case we are, for instance, not exposing any node or relationship objects, but provide direct methods for manipulating
 * them by ids instead.
 *
 * The driver for this was clarifying who is responsible for ensuring query isolation. By exposing a query concept in
 * the core layer, we can move that responsibility outside of the scope of cypher.
