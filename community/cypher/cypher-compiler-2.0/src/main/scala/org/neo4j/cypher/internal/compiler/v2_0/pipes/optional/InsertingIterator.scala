 * This class makes sure that if the inner iterator has to pull out multiple elements from the listener,

 * It is used to insert the nulls when doing OPTIONAL MATCH, and to create the missing pattern when
 * doing MERGE with patterns.
 *
 * @param listener An iterator that keeps track of things moving through it
 * @param inner The iterator that in turn consumes the listener iterator
 * @param inserter A method that can produce a new ExecutionContext with more data in it
