/**
 * Declares a method as a Function, meaning the method can be called from the
 * cypher query language.
 * <p>
 * Functions accept input, use that input to perform work, and then return a value. The work performed usually
 * involves one or more resources, such as a {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService}. Functions are read-only, i.e
 * can't update neither the graph nor update schema.
 *
 * <h2>Input declaration</h2>
 * A function can accept input arguments, which is defined in the arguments to the
 * annotated method. Each method argument must be a valid Function input type, and
 * each must be annotated with the {@link Name} annotation, declaring the input name.
 * <p>
 * Valid input types are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link String}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Long} or {@code long}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Double} or {@code double}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Number}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Boolean} or {@code boolean}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Node}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Relationship}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Path}</li>
 *     <li>{@link java.util.Map} with key {@link String} and value of any type in this list, including {@link java.util.Map}</li>
 *     <li>{@link java.util.List} with element type of any type in this list, including {@link java.util.List}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Object}, meaning any valid input types above</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Output declaration</h2>
 * A function must always return a single value.
 * <p>
 * Valid return types are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link String}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Long} or {@code long}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Double} or {@code double}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Number}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Boolean} or {@code boolean}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Node}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Relationship}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Path}</li>
 *     <li>{@link java.util.Map} with key {@link String} and value of any type in this list, including {@link java.util.Map}</li>
 *     <li>{@link java.util.List} of elements of any valid field type, including {@link java.util.List}</li>
 *     <li>{@link Object}, meaning any of the valid field types above</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Resource declarations</h2>
 * The function method itself can contain arbitrary Java code - but in order to work with the underlying graph,
 * it must have access to the graph API. This is done by declaring fields in the function class, and annotating
 * them with the {@link Context} annotation. Fields declared this way are automatically injected with the
 * requested resource. This is how functions gain access to APIs to do work with.
 * <p>
 * All fields in the class containing the function declaration must either be static; or it must be public, non-final
 * and annotated with {@link Context}.
 * <p>
 * Resources supported by default are as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.logging.Log}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.neo4j.procedure.TerminationGuard}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle and state</h2>
 * The class that declares your function method may be re-instantiated before each call. Because of this,
 * no regular state can be stored in the fields of the function.
 * <p>
 * If you want to maintain state between invocations to your procedure, simply use a static field. Note that
 * procedures may be called concurrently, meaning you need to take care to ensure the state you store in
 * static fields can be safely accessed by multiple callers simultaneously.
