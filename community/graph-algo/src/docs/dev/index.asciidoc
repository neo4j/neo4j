= Graph Algorithms

Neo4j graph algorithms is a component that contains Neo4j implementations of some common algorithms for graphs.
It includes algorithms like:

* Shortest paths,
* all paths,
* all simple paths,
* Dijkstra and
* A*.

The graph algorithms are included with Neo4j.

For usage examples, see <<rest-api-graph-algos>> (REST API) and <<tutorials-java-embedded-graph-algo>> (embedded database).
The shortest path algorithm can be used from Cypher as well, see <<query-shortest-path>>.
