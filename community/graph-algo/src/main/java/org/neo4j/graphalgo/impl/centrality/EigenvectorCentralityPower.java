/**
 * Computing eigenvector centrality with the "power method". Convergence is
 * dependent of the eigenvalues of the input adjacency matrix (the network). If
 * the two largest eigenvalues are u1 and u2, a small factor u2/u1 will give a
 * faster convergence (i.e. faster computation). NOTE: Currently only works on
 * Doubles.
 * @complexity The {@link CostEvaluator} is called once for every relationship
 *             in each iteration. Assuming this is done in constant time, the
 *             total time complexity is O(i(n + m)) when i iterations are done.
