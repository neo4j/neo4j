/**
 * This serves as a base class for all centrality algorithms based on shortest
 * paths. All these algorithms make use of the SingleSourceShortestPath object
 * to calculate the shortest paths which can be adapted for the kind of graph to
 * run the calculation on and set up with proper calculation limits. The main
 * purpose of this class, except containing everything common to these
 * algorithms, is to open up for parallel computation of several of these
 * algorithms at the same time. This could be made possible by reusing the
 * SingleSourceShortestPath computation made for every node.
