/**
 * 
 * Facilities for finding occurrences of patterns in a Neo4j graph.
 * 
 * The main classes for defining a graph pattern is the
 * {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode} and the
 * {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternRelationship}. The actual matching
 * is performed by the {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatcher}.
 *
 * A simple example of matching a friend of a friend pattern:
 * <pre><code>
 * {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode}   me = {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode#PatternNode() new PatternNode()},
 *         myFriend = {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode#PatternNode() new PatternNode()},
 * friendOfMyFriend = {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode#PatternNode() new PatternNode()};
 *
 * me.{@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode#createRelationshipTo(org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode, org.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipType, org.neo4j.graphdb.Direction) createRelationshipTo}( myFriend, {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipType FoafDomain.FRIEND}, {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Direction#BOTH Direction.BOTH} );
 * myFriend.{@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode#createRelationshipTo(org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternNode, org.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipType, org.neo4j.graphdb.Direction) createRelationshipTo}( friendOfMyFriend, {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.RelationshipType FoafDomain.FRIEND}, {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Direction#BOTH Direction.BOTH} );
 *
 * {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatcher} matcher = {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatcher#getMatcher() PatternMatcher.getMatcher()};
 * for ( {@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatch} match : matcher.{@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatcher#match(PatternNode, org.neo4j.graphdb.Node) match}( me, {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Node startNode} ) )
 * {
 *     {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.Node} foaf = match.{@link org.neo4j.graphmatching.PatternMatch#getNodeFor(PatternNode) getNodeFor}( friendOfMyFriend );
 * }
 * </code></pre>
