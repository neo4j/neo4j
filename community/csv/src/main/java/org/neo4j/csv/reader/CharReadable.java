 * A {@link Readable}, but focused on {@code char[]}, via a {@link SectionedCharBuffer} with one of the main reasons
 * that {@link Reader#read(CharBuffer)} creates a new {@code char[]} as big as the data it's about to read
 * every call. However {@link Reader#read(char[], int, int)} doesn't, and so leaves no garbage.
 *
 * The fact that this is a separate interface means that {@link Readable} instances need to be wrapped,
 * but that's fine since the buffer size should be reasonably big such that {@link #read(SectionedCharBuffer, int)}
 * isn't called too often. Therefore the wrapping overhead should not be noticeable at all.
 *
 * Also took the opportunity to let {@link CharReadable} extends {@link Closeable}, something that
 * {@link Readable} doesn't.
