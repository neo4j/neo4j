/**
 * Has a similar role to a {@link CharBuffer}, but is tailored to how {@link BufferedCharSeeker}
 * works and to be able to take full advantage of {@link ThreadAheadReadable}.
 *
 * First of all this thing wraps a {@code char[]} where the array, while still being one array,
 * is sectioned into two equally sized parts: the back and the front. The flow of things is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Characters are read from a {@link Reader} using {@link #readFrom(Reader)} into the front section,
 * i.e. starting from the middle of the array and forwards.</li>
 * <li>Consumer of the read characters access the {@link #array()} and starts reading from the {@link #pivot()}
 * point, which is the middle, to finally reach the end, denoted by {@link #front()} (exclusive).
 * During the reading typically characters are read into some sort of fields/values, and so the last characters
 * of the array might represent an incomplete value.</li>
 * <li>For this reason, before reading more values into the array, the characters making up the last incomplete
 * value can be moved to the back section using {@link #compact(SectionedCharBuffer, int)} where
 * after that call {@link #back()} will point to the index in the {@link #array()} containing the first value
 * in the array.</li>
 * <li>Now more characters can be read into the front section using {@link #readFrom(Reader)}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This divide into back and front section enables a behaviour in {@link ThreadAheadReadable} where the
 * thread that reads ahead reads into the front section of another buffer, a double buffer,
 * and the current buffer that {@link BufferedCharSeeker} is working with can
 * {@link #compact(SectionedCharBuffer, int)} its last incomplete characters into that double buffer
 * and flip so that the {@link BufferedCharSeeker} continues to read from the other buffer, i.e. flips
 * buffer every call to {@link ThreadAheadReadable#read(SectionedCharBuffer, int)}. Without these sections
 * the entire double buffer would have to be copied into the char seekers buffer to get the same behavior.
