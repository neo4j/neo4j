/**
 * A PageCursor is returned from {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PagedFile#io(long, int)},
 * and is used to scan through pages and process them in a consistent and safe fashion.
 * <p>
 * A page must be processed in the following manner:
 * <pre><code>
 *     try ( PageCursor cursor = pagedFile.io( pageId, pf_flags ) )
 *     {
 *         // Use 'if' for processing a single page,
 *         // use 'while' for scanning through pages:
 *         if ( cursor.next() )
 *         {
 *             do
 *             {
 *                 processPage( cursor );
 *             } while ( cursor.shouldRetry() );
 *             // Any finalising, non-repeatable post-processing
 *             // goes here.
 *         }
 *     }
 *     catch ( IOException e )
 *     {
 *         // handle the error, somehow
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>There are a couple of things to this pattern that are worth noting:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>We use a try-with-resources clause to make sure that the resources
 *     associated with the PageCursor are always released properly.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>We use an if-clause for the next() call if we are only processing
 *     a single page, to make sure that the page exist and is accessible to us.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>We use a while-clause for next() if we are scanning through pages.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>We do our processing of the page in a do-while-retry loop, to
 *     make sure that we processed a page that was in a consistent state.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * You can alternatively use the {@link #next(long)} method, to navigate the
 * pages you need in a non-linear fashion.
