     * Static implementation of {@link FileSystemAbstraction#streamFilesRecursive(File)} that does not require
     * any external state, other than what is presented through the given {@link FileSystemAbstraction}.
     *
     * Return a stream of {@link FileHandle file handles} for every file in the given directory, and its
     * sub-directories.
     * <p>
     * Alternatively, if the {@link File} given as an argument refers to a file instead of a directory, then a stream
     * will be returned with a file handle for just that file.
     * <p>
     * The stream is based on a snapshot of the file tree, so changes made to the tree using the returned file handles
     * will not be reflected in the stream.
     * <p>
     * No directories will be returned. Only files. If a file handle ends up leaving a directory empty through a
     * rename or a delete, then the empty directory will automatically be deleted as well.
     * Likewise, if a file is moved to a path where not all of the directories in the path exists, then those missing
     * directories will be created prior to the file rename.
     *
     * @param directory The base directory to start streaming files from, or the specific individual file to stream.
     * @param fs The {@link FileSystemAbstraction} to use for manipulating files.
     * @return A {@link Stream} of {@link FileHandle}s
     * @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs, possibly with the canonicalisation of the paths.
