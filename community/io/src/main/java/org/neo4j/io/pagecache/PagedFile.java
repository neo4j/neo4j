     *     {

     *             while ( cursor.shouldRetry() );
     *         }
     *     }
     * </code></pre>
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PageCursor PageCursors} are {@link AutoCloseable}, so interacting with them
     * using <em>try-with-resources</em> is recommended.
     * <p>
     * The returned PageCursor is initially not bound, so {@link PageCursor#next() next} must be called on it before it
     * can be used.
     * <p>
     * The first {@code next} call will advance the cursor to the initial page, as given by the {@code pageId}
     * parameter. Until then, the cursor won't be bound to any page, the {@link PageCursor#getCurrentPageId()} method
     * will return the {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PageCursor#UNBOUND_PAGE_ID} constant, and attempts at reading from
     * or writing to the cursor will throw a {@link NullPointerException}.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code next} call, if it returns {@code true}, the cursor will be bound to a page, and the get and put
     * methods will access that page.
     * <p>
     * After a call to {@link PageCursor#rewind()}, the cursor will return to its initial state.
     * <p>
     * The {@code pf_flags} argument expresses the intent of the IO operation. It is a bitmap that combines various
     * {@code PF_*} constants. You must always specify your desired locking behaviour, with either
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PagedFile#PF_SHARED_WRITE_LOCK} or
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PagedFile#PF_SHARED_READ_LOCK}.
     * <p>
     * The two locking modes cannot be combined, but other intents can be combined with them. For instance, if you want
     * to write to a page, but also make sure that you don't write beyond the end of the file, then you can express
     * your intent with {@code PF_SHARED_WRITE_LOCK | PF_NO_GROW} â€“ note how the flags are combined with a bitwise-OR
     * operator.
     * Arithmetic addition can also be used, but might not make it as clear that we are dealing with a bit-set.
     *
     * @param pageId The initial file-page-id, that the cursor will be bound to
     * after the first call to <code>next</code>.
     * @param pf_flags A bitmap of <code>PF_*</code> constants composed with
     * the bitwise-OR operator, that expresses the desired
     * locking behaviour, and other hints.
