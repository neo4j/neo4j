     * Initiate an IO interaction with the contents of the paged file.
     *
     * <p>The basic structure of an interaction looks like this:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *     try ( PageCursor cursor = pagedFile.io( startingPageId, intentFlags ) )
     *     {
     *         if ( cursor.next() )

     *             do
     *             {
     *                 // perform read or write operations on the page
     *             }
     *             while ( cursor.shouldRetry() );
     *         }
     *     }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PageCursor PageCursors} are
     * <code>AutoCloseable</code>, so interacting with them using
     * <code>try-with-resources</code> is recommended.
     *
     * <p>The returned PageCursor is initially not bound, so
     * {@link PageCursor#next() next} must be called on it before it can be
     * used.
     *
     * <p>The first <code>next</code> call will advance the cursor to the
     * initial page, as given by the <code>pageId</code> parameter.
     * Until then, the cursor won't be bound to any page, the
     * {@link PageCursor#getCurrentPageId()} method will return the
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PageCursor#UNBOUND_PAGE_ID} constant, and
     * attempts at reading from or writing to the cursor will throw a
     * NullPointerException.
     *
     * <p>After the <code>next</code> call, if it returns <code>true</code>,
     * the cursor will be bound to a page, and the get and put methods will
     * access that page.
     *
     * <p>After a call to {@link PageCursor#rewind()}, the cursor will return
     * to its initial state.
     *
     * <p>The <code>pf_flags</code> argument expresses the intent of the IO
     * operation.
     * It is a bitmap that combines various <code>PF_*</code> constants.
     * You must always specify your desired locking behaviour, with either
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PagedFile#PF_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK} or
     * {@link org.neo4j.io.pagecache.PagedFile#PF_SHARED_LOCK}.
     * The two locking modes cannot be combined, but other intents can be
     * combined with them.
     * For instance, if you want to write to a page, but also make sure that
     * you don't write beyond the end of the file, then you can express your
     * intent with <code>PF_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK | PF_NO_GROW</code> â€“ note how the
     * flags are combined with a bitwise-OR operator.
     *
     *
     *
     * @param pageId The initial file-page-id, that the cursor will be bound to
     *               after the first call to <code>next</code>.
     * @param pf_flags A bitmap of <code>PF_*</code> constants composed with
     *                 the bitwise-OR operator, that expresses the desired
     *                 locking behaviour, and other hints.
     * @return A PageCursor in its initial unbound state.
     * Never <code>null</code>.
     * @throws IOException if there was an error accessing the underlying file.
