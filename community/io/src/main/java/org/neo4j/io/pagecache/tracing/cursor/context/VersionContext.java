/**
 * Context that contains state of ongoing versioned data read or write.
 *
 * <br/>
 * Context can be in one of two states:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Read context: reading is performed for a version that context was initialised with.
 *     As soon as reader that associated with a context will observe data with version that it higher,
 *     context will be marked as dirty.
 *     <br/>
 *     For example, when context is initialised with last closed transaction id and if
 *     at the end of reading operation context is not marked as dirty its guarantee that context did not
 *     encounter any data from more recent transaction.</li>
 *     <li>Write context: context that performs data modifications. Any modifications will be tagged with
 *     some version that write context was initialised with.
 *     <br/>
 *     For example, commit will start write context that with a version that is equal to current
 *     committing transaction id.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * By default non context will be initialised with last closed transaction id which is equal to {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}
 * and transaction id that is equal to minimal possible transaction id: 1.
