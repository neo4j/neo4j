/**
 * OffHeapPageLock is a sequence-based lock like StampedLock, but entirely non-blocking, and with special lock modes
 * that are needed by the Muninn page cache.
 * <p>
 * The OffHeapPageLock supports non-blocking optimistic concurrent read locks, non-blocking concurrent write locks,
 * and non-blocking pessimistic flush and exclusive locks.
 * <p>
 * The optimistic read lock works through validation, so at the end of the critical section, the read lock has to be
 * validated and, if the validation fails, the critical section has to be retried. The read-lock acquires a stamp
 * at the start of the critical section, which is then validated at the end of the critical section. The stamp is
 * invalidated if any write lock or exclusive lock was overlapping with the read lock.
 * <p>
 * The concurrent write locks works by assuming that writes are always non-conflicting, so no validation is required.
 * However, the write locks will check if a pessimistic exclusive lock is held at the start of the critical
 * section, and if so, fail to be acquired. The write locks will invalidate all optimistic read locks. The write lock
 * is try-lock only, and will never block. A successfully taken write lock will raise the <em>modified</em> bit, if it
 * is not already raised. When the modified bit is raised, {@link #isModified(long)} will return {@code true}.
 * <p>
 * The flush lock is also non-blocking (try-lock only), but can only be held by one thread at a time for
 * implementation reasons. The flush lock is meant for flushing the data in a page. This means that flush locks do not
 * invalidate optimistic read locks, nor does it prevent overlapping write locks. However, it does prevent other
 * overlapping flush and exclusive locks. Likewise, if another flush or exclusive lock is held, the attempt to take the
 * flush lock will fail. The release of the flush lock will lower the modified bit if, and only if, it was not
 * overlapping with any write lock <em>and</em> the flush lock release method was given a success flag. The success flag
 * is necessary because the flush operation itself is an IO operation that may fail for any number of reasons.
 * <p>
 * The exclusive lock will also invalidate the optimistic read locks. The exclusive lock is try-lock only, and will
 * never block. If a write or flush lock is currently held, the attempt to take the exclusive lock will fail, and
 * the exclusive lock will likewise prevent write and flush locks from being taken.
 * <p>
 * Because all lock types are non-blocking, and because the lock-word itself is external to the implementation, this
 * class does not need to maintain any state by itself. Thus, the class cannot be instantiated, and all methods are
 * static.
 * <p>
 * Note that the lock-word is assumed to be 8 bytes, and should ideally be aligned to 8-byte boundaries, and ideally
 * run on platforms that support 8-byte-wide atomic memory operations.

     * Bits for counting concurrent write-locks. We use 17 bits because our pages are most likely 8192 bytes, and
