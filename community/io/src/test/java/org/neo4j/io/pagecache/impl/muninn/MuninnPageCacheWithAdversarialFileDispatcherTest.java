/**
 * Use a special runner that will put the AccessibleFileDispatcher and the DelegateFileDispatcher in the -Xbootclasspath
 *
 * We already have the test-jar from the 'unsafe' module on our classpath. This custom test runner will put that
 * classpath entry on the boot classpath. We refer to that classpath entry through the UnsafeUtilTest class, because
 * we are not allowed to refer to the AccessibleFileDispatcher and the DelegateFileDispatcher classes directly. If we
 * try to load them normally, we will be told that they are not allowed to refer to the sun.nio.ch.FileDispatcher
 * superclass.
 *
 * To implement the boot classpath hack, the BootClassPathRunner will run the test in a sub-process, and tunnel the
 * JUnit communication through RMI.
