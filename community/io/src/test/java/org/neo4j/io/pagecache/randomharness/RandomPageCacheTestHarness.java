/**
 * The RandomPageCacheTestHarness can plan and run random page cache tests, repeatably if necessary, and verify that
 * the behaviour of the page cache is correct to some degree. For instance, it can verify that records don't end up
 * overlapping each other in the mapped files, that records end up at the correct locations in the files, and that
 * records don't end up in the wrong files. The harness can also execute separate preparation and verification steps,
 * before and after executing the planned test respectively, and it can integrate with the adversarial file system
 * for fault injection, and arbitrary PageCacheTracers.
 *
 * See {@link org.neo4j.test.LinearHistoryPageCacheTracerTest} for an example of how to configure and use the harness.
