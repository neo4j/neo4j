Important-Read Carefully: This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an
individual or a single legal entity) and Neo Technology, Inc. (“Licensor”) and covers your use of install4j and related 
software components ("Software Product" or install4j) that are licensed to Licensor by ej-technologies GmbH
(ej-technologies).

If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, then do not download, install or use the Software Product or the Software
Product License. By explicitly accepting this EULA you are acknowledging and agreeing to be bound by the following 
terms:

Grant of License

The Software Product is owned by ej-technologies. It is licensed, not sold. The Software Product is protected by copyright
laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. ej-technologies reserves 
all intellectual property rights, including copyrights and trademark rights.

Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable sub- license to use the Software Product for your internal use and 
solely in conjunction with your use of Neo4j software.  You may not disclose the Software Product License in any way.

You may make copies of the Software Product and the Software Product License as reasonably necessary for the use
authorized above, including as needed for backup and/or archival purposes. No other copies may be made. Each copy 
must reproduce all copyright and other proprietary rights notices on or in the Software Product.

Restrictions

You may not use, copy, or distribute the Software Product, except as granted by this EULA, without written authorization
from Licensor or ej-technologies.  You may not tamper with, alter, or use the Software Product in a way that disables, 
circumvents, or otherwise defeats its built-in licensing verification and enforcement capabilities.  You may not remove or 
alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notice, legend, symbol or label in the Software Product. You may 
not modify or create derivative copies of the Software Product License.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile, defeat 
license encryption mechanisms, or disassemble the Software Product or Software Product License except and only to the 
extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. You may not rent, lease, 
lend, or in any way distribute or transfer any rights in this EULA or the Software Product to third parties without 
Licensor’s and ej-technologies' written approval, and subject to written agreement by the recipient of the terms of this 
EULA.

The Software Product is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line
control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, in which the failure of the Software 
Product, or any software, tool, process, or service that was developed using the Software Product, could lead directly to 
death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly, Licensor, ej-
technologies and its suppliers and licensors specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk 
Activities. You agree that Licensor, ej-technologies and its suppliers and licensors will not be liable for any claims or 
damages arising from the use of the Software Product, or any software, tool, process, or service that was developed using 
the Software Product, in such applications.

Warranty Disclaimer

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR, EJ-TECHNOLOGIES AND ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS AND
LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT REMAINS WITH YOU.

Limitation of Liability

(a)	Consequential Damages Waiver.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHALL ANY LICENSOR PARTY OR EJ-TECHNOLOGIES BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION AND THE LIKE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE AND/OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

(b)	Limitation of Damages.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S OR EJ-TECHNOLIGIES TOTAL
CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).  THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE
FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES,
SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN SUCH EVENT, THE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR AND
EJ-TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUCH DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN SUCH JURISDICTION.

such event, you must destroy all copies of the Software Product and Software Product Licenses.

This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA. The United Nations Convention for the International
Sale of Goods shall not apply.
