     * commit or done, also unknown to the tx log, the store still recovers.
     * 
     * The main problem was that first each data source recovered what it could,
     * but kept any 2PC transactions that it didn't know what to do with around
     * for the tx manager, later during the recovery process, telling them what
     * to do with. If the tx manager (the tx log it has) didn't have any
     * recollection of any such a transaction it wouldn't even notify that data
     * source. The result would be that the database started, but one or more
     * data sources would be in a state where it was awaiting recovery to complete.
     * 
     * The particular case bringing this up was a transaction that failed to write
     * the 2PC log entry, due to the thread being interrupted, but the transaction
     * was successfully rolled back after that.
