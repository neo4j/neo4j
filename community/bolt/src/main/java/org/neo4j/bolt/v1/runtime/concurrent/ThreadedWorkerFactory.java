/**
 * A {@link WorkerFactory} implementation that creates one thread for every session started, requests are then executed
 * in the session-specific thread.
 *
 * This resolves a tricky issue where sharing threads for multiple sessions can cause complex deadlocks. It does so
 * at the expense of creating, potentially, many threads. However, this approach is much less complex than using
 * a thread pool, and is the preferred approach of several highly scalable relational databases.
 *
 * If we find ourselves with tens of thousands of concurrent sessions per neo4j instance, we may want to introduce an
 * alternate strategy.
