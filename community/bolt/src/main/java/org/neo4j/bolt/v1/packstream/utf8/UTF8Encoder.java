/**
 * A non-thread-safe UTF8 encoding interface, delegates to near-zero GC overhead
 * UTF8 implementations on HotSpot, falls back to stdlib encoder if on other JVM.
 *
 * This implementation solves a major GC bottleneck in that we don't have to
 * allocate objects to encode most strings.
 *
 * We currently do "bulk" encoding, where the whole string is turned
 * into UTF-8 before it gets returned. This is simply a limitation in
 * PackStream currently in that we need to know the length of utf-8
 * strings up-front, so we can't stream them out.
 *
 * This becomes an issue for very large strings, and should be remedied
 * in Bolt V2 by introducing streaming options for Strings in the same
 * manner we've discussed adding streaming lists.
 *
 * Once that is resolved, we could have a method here that took a
 * WritableByteChannel or similar instead.
