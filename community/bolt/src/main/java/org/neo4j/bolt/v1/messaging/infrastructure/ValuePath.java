/**
 * A ValuePath is an implementation of the Path interface that is used to
 * represent a walk through a graph within the context of remoting. It is
 * particularly important to ensure a compact (though obviously lossless)
 * on-wire representation of a Path as a naive implementation may contain
 * duplicate information thereby increasing the number of bytes required
 * to be transmitted.
 * <p/>
 * The representation used by Neo4jPack and expected by the ValuePath
 * constructor here consists of three parts: a unique set of nodes within
 * the path, a similar unique set of unbound relationships (i.e. without
 * start and end information) and a list of path sequence information that
 * refers to the entities themselves. In PackStream structural representation,
 * this is as follows:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     Structure Path 'P' {
 *         List&lt;Node&gt; nodes
 *         List&lt;UnboundRelationship&gt; relationships
 *         List&lt;Integer&gt; sequence
 *     }
 *
 *     Structure UnboundRelationship 'r' {
 *         Identity identity
 *         String type
 *         Map&lt;String,Object&gt; properties
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Within the Path structure, several caveats apply. Firstly, while the nodes
 * may generally be listed in any order, a valid Path must contain at least
 * one node and the first such node must correspond to the path's start node.
 * The relationship list however may be empty (for zero length paths) and
 * relationships may appear in any order with no restriction.
 * <p/>
 * The sequence information contains alternating pointers to nodes and
 * relationships in the order in which they appear in the path. Each pointer
 * takes the form of an integer, which in the case of nodes simply references
 * the zero-based index of that node.
 * <p/>
 * Relationship pointers are less straightforward, using a one-based indexing
 * system (i.e. relationship #1 refers to the item 0 from the relationship
 * list. Additionally, the sign of the index is relevant: a positive index
 * denotes that the relationship was traversed with its direction, a
 * negative index denotes that the relationship was traversed against its
 * direction. Note that relationship items do not contain endpoint information,
 * this is described by this sequential context.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, the first sequence value will always be 0 by definition. Therefore,
 * this value is never actually transmitted and is instead reconstituted by the
 * receiving agent.
 * <p/>
 * Take as an example, the following path:
 * <pre>
 *     (a)--&gt;(b)&lt;--(a)--&gt;(c)--&gt;(d)
 * </pre>
 * Here, the nodes would be uniquely listed as [(a), (b), (c), (d)] and the
 * relationships as [(a:b), (a:c), (c:d)]. Applying zero-based and one-based
 * indexing to these lists respectively, we get:
 * <pre>
 *       0    1    2    3         1      2      3
 *     [(a), (b), (c), (d)]    [(a:b), (a:c), (c:d)]
 * </pre>
 * Applying these indexes to the original path then gives us:
 * <pre>
 *               (a)--&gt;(b)&lt;--(a)--&gt;(c)--&gt;(d)
 *     Node ID :  0     1     0     2     3
 *      Rel ID :     1     1     2     3
 * </pre>
 * And negating relationships that are traversed backwards, we get:
 * <pre>
 *               (a)--&gt;(b)&lt;--(a)--&gt;(c)--&gt;(d)
 *     Node ID :  0     1     0     2     3
 *      Rel ID :    +1    -1    +2    +3
 * </pre>
 * Finally, we can drop the leading 0 from the Path structure and combine the
 * sequence information with the other path data. This results in an overall
 * Path representation as below:
 * <pre>
 *     Structure Path 'P' {
 *         nodes         = [(a), (b), (c), (d)]
 *         relationships = [(a:b), (a:c), (c:d)]
 *         sequence      = [+1, 1, -1, 0, +2, 2, +3, 3]
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Therefore, for the original path containing five nodes and four relationships,
 * we end up transmitting only four nodes, three unbound relationships and eight
 * bytes of sequence data (small integers require only a single byte in PackStream).
