/**
 * A way to execute groovy scripts from the shell. It doesn't use the groovy
 * classes directly, but instead purely via reflections... This gives the
 * advantage of not being dependent on groovy at compile-time.
 * 
 * So if the groovy classes is in the classpath at run-time then groovy scripts
 * can be executed, otherwise it will say that "Groovy isn't available".
 * 
 * It has the old style script/argument format of:
 * sh$ gsh --script1 arg1 arg2 arg3 --script2 arg1 arg2
 * 
 * The paths to look for groovy scripts is decided by the environment variable
 * GSH_PATH, also there are some default paths: ".", "script", "src/script".
