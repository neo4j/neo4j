--------------------
o dbinfo command now able to print simple values as well as arrays and compound values as JSON output.

  to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside

o Some package renaming (org.neo4j.util.shell --> org.neo4j.shell).
o Neo4j Apps moved from the neo component to the shell component
  (into org.neo4j.shell.neo package).
