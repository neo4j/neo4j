--------------------
o dbinfo command now able to print simple values as well as arrays and compound values as JSON output.
o A shell server which isn't remotely avaiable doesn't touch RMI, neither does a client which connects
  to a server within the same JVM. This makes for less RMI garbage when forgetting to call shutdown().
o Fixes problem with eval command in that it couldn't execute a single-line command, which made it impossible
  to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)
