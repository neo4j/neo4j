== Transport layer
The protocol supports both regular http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket[socket] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[WebSocket] transport layers for sending and receiving messages.
The transport layer is versioned along with the rest of the data protocol and is responsible for:

* Negotiating Neo4j protocol version
* Establishing and terminating sessions
* Routing messages from clients to specific sessions and back

=== Sessions

Each connection to the server creates a new *session* that lives until that connection is closed.
Each session is isolated and the server keep track of the current state, based on the requests and responses exchanged within that session.

Neo4j uses _sticky sessions_, which means that, in a database cluster, each session is tied to one specific Neo4j instance.

=== Connecting

To begin a new session, the client connects using either a regular socket or a WebSocket.
Once connected, both transport layers can be treated identically.

A regular socket connection should be made to the host and port Neo4j has been configured to use for its regular socket listener.
The default port for regular socket connections is *7687*.
Similar configuration exists for the WebSocket listener.
The default port for WebSocket connections is *8776*.

=== Handshake

After connecting, a handshake takes place to establish which protocol version should be used for that connection.
This handshake is a _version-independent_ mini-protocol which is guaranteed to remain the same, regardless of preferred or available protocol versions.

In the handshake, the client proposes up to four protocol versions it supports, in order of preference.
The proposal is always represented as four 32-bit unsigned integers.
Each integer represents a proposed protocol version to use, or zero (`00 00 00 00`) for "none".

The server will respond with a single 32-bit unsigned integer representing the chosen protocol.
This will always represent the highest-priority protocol version the server supports.
If none of the proposed protocols are supported, the server responds with zero (`00 00 00 00`) and closes the connection.

=== Message framing

The transport protocol uses a framing layer to wrap messages.

Each message is transferred as one or more `chunks` of data.
Each chunk starts with a two-byte header, an unsigned big-endian 16-bit integer, representing the size of the chunk.
The header is not counted towards this size.
A message can be divided across multiple chunks, allowing client and server alike to efficiently transfer messages larger than their network buffers.

Each message ends with two bytes with the value `00 00`, these are not counted towards the chunk length.

=== Disconnecting

A session ends when its communication socket is closed.
Typically, this will be closed by the client.
