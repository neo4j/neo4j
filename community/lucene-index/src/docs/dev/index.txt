Indexing
========

Indexing in Neo4j can be done in two different ways:

. The database itself is a _natural index_ consisting of its relationships of different types between nodes.
  For example a tree structure can be layered on top of the data and used for index lookups performed by a traverser.
. Separate index engines can be used, with http://lucene.apache.org/java/{lucene-version}/index.html[Apache Lucene] being the default backend included with Neo4j.

This chapter demonstrate how to use the second type of indexing, focusing on Lucene.

[[indexing-introduction]]
== Introduction ==

Indexing operations are part of the http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/package-summary.html[Neo4j index API].

Each index is tied to a unique, user-specified name (for example "first_name" or "books") and can index either http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/Node.html[nodes] or http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/Relationship.html[relationships].

The default index implementation is provided by the +neo4j-lucene-index+ component, which is included in the standard Neo4j download.
It can also be downloaded separately from http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/neo4j/neo4j-lucene-index/ .
For Maven users, the +neo4j-lucene-index+ component has the coordinates +org.neo4j:neo4j-lucene-index+ and should be used with the same version of +org.neo4j:neo4j-kernel+.
Different versions of the index and kernel components are not compatible in the general case.
Both components are included transitively by the +org.neo4j:neo4j:pom+ artifact which makes it simple to keep the versions in sync.

For initial import of data using indexes, see <<indexing-batchinsert>>.

.Transactions
NOTE: All modifying index operations must be performed inside a transaction, as with any mutating operation in Neo4j.


[[indexing-create]]
== Create ==

An index is created if it doesn't exist when you ask for it.
Unless you give it a custom configuration, it will be created with default configuration and backend.

To set the stage for our examples, let's create some indexes to begin with:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=createIndexes
----

This will create two node indexes and one relationship index with default configuration.
See <<indexing-relationships>> for more information specific to relationship indexes.

See <<indexing-create-advanced>> for how to create _fulltext_ indexes.

You can also check if an index exists like this:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=checkIfExists
----


[[indexing-delete]]
== Delete ==

Indexes can be deleted.
When deleting, the entire contents of the index will be removed as well as its associated configuration.
A new index can be created with the same name at a later point in time.

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=delete
----

Note that the actual deletion of the index is made during the commit of _the surrounding transaction_.
Calls made to such an index instance after http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html#delete%28%29[delete()] has been called are invalid inside that transaction as well as outside (if the transaction is successful), but will become valid again if the transaction is rolled back.


[[indexing-add]]
== Add ==

Each index supports associating any number of key-value pairs with any number of entities (nodes or relationships), where each association between entity and key-value pair is performed individually.
To begin with, let's add a few nodes to the indexes:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=createNodes
----

Note that there can be multiple values associated with the same entity and key.

Next up, we'll create relationships and index them as well:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=createRelationships
----

After these operations, our example graph looks like this:

include::movie-and-actor-graph.txt[]

[[indexing-remove]]
== Remove ==

http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html#remove%28T,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object%29[Removing] from an index is similar to adding, but can be done by supplying one of the following combinations of arguments:

* entity
* entity, key
* entity, key, value

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=removeNodeFromIndex
----


[[indexing-update]]
== Update ==

[IMPORTANT]
To update an index entry, the old one must be removed and a new one added.
For details on removing index entries, see <<indexing-remove>>.

Remember that a node or relationship can be associated with any number of key-value pairs in an index.
This means that you can index a node or relationship with many key-value pairs that have the same key.
In the case where a property value changes and you'd like to update the index, it's not enough to just index the new value - you'll have to remove the old value as well.

Here's a code example for that demonstrates how it's done:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=update
----


[[indexing-search]]
== Search ==

An index can be searched in two ways, http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html#get%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object%29[get] and http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html#query%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object%29[query].
The +get+ method will return exact matches to the given key-value pair, whereas +query+ exposes querying capabilities directly from the backend used by the index.
For example the http://lucene.apache.org/java/{lucene-version}/queryparsersyntax.html[Lucene query syntax] can be used directly with the default indexing backend.

[[indexing-search-get]]
=== Get ===

This is how to search for a single exact match:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=getSingleNode
----

http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/IndexHits.html[IndexHits] is an +Iterable+ with some additional useful methods. For example http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/IndexHits.html#getSingle%28%29[getSingle()] returns the first and only item from the result iterator, or +null+ if there isn't any hit.

Here's how to get a single relationship by exact matching and retrieve its start and end nodes:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=getSingleRelationship
----

Finally, we can iterate over all exact matches from a relationship index:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=getRelationships
----

IMPORTANT: In you don't iterate through all the hits, http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/IndexHits.html#close%28%29[IndexHits.close()] must be called explicitly.

[[indexing-search-query]]
=== Query ===

There are two query methods, one which uses a key-value signature where the value represents a query for values with the given key only.
The other method is more generic and supports querying for more than one key-value pair in the same query.

Here's an example using the key-query option:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=actorsQuery
----

In the following example the query uses multiple keys:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=matrixQuery
----

NOTE: Beginning a wildcard search with "*" or "?" is discouraged by Lucene, but will nevertheless work.

CAUTION: You can't have _any whitespace_ in the search term with this syntax.
  See <<indexing-lucene-query-objects>> for how to do that.


[[indexing-relationships]]
== Relationship indexes ==

An index for relationships is just like an index for nodes, extended by providing support to constrain a search to relationships with a specific start and/or end nodes
These extra methods reside in the http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/RelationshipIndex.html[RelationshipIndex] interface which extends http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html[Index<Relationship>].

Example of querying a relationship index:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=queryForRelationships
----

And here's an example for the special case of searching for a specific relationship type:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=queryForRelationshipType
----

Such an index can be useful if your domain has nodes with a very large number of relationships between them, since it reduces the search time for a relationship between two nodes.
A good example where this approach pays dividends is in time series data, where we have readings represented as a relationship per occurrence.

[[indexing-scores]]
== Scores ==

The +IndexHits+ interface exposes http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/IndexHits.html#currentScore%28%29[scoring] so that the index can communicate scores for the hits.
Note that the result is not sorted by the score unless you explicitly specify that.
See <<indexing-lucene-sort>> for how to sort by score.


[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=queryWithScore
----


[[indexing-create-advanced]]
== Configuration and fulltext indexes ==

At the time of creation extra configuration can be specified to control the behavior of the index and which backend to use.
For example to create a Lucene fulltext index:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=fulltext
----

Here's an example of how to create an exact index which is case-insensitive:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=org/neo4j/index/impl/lucene/TestLuceneIndex.java
tag=exact-case-insensitive
----

TIP: In order to search for tokenized words, the +query+ method has to be used.
  The +get+ method will only match the full string value, not the tokens.

The configuration of the index is persisted once the index has been created.
The +provider+ configuration key is interpreted by Neo4j, but any other configuration is passed onto the backend index (e.g. Lucene) to interpret.

.Lucene indexing configuration parameters
[options="header",frame="none",cols="<20m,<30,<50"]
|========================================================
| Parameter                 | Possible values   | Effect
| type | +exact+, +fulltext+ |
  +exact+ is the default and uses a Lucene http://lucene.apache.org/java/{lucene-version}/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KeywordAnalyzer.html[keyword analyzer].
  +fulltext+ uses a white-space tokenizer in its analyzer.
| to_lower_case | `true`, `false` | This parameter goes together with +type+: +fulltext+ and converts values to lower case during both additions and querying, making the index case insensitive. Defaults to `true`.
| analyzer | the full class name of an http://lucene.apache.org/java/{lucene-version}/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html[Analyzer] | Overrides the +type+ so that a custom analyzer can be used.
  Note: +to_lower_case+ still affects lowercasing of string queries. 
  If the custom analyzer uppercases the indexed tokens, string queries will not match as expected. 
|========================================================


[[indexing-lucene-extras]]
== Extra features for Lucene indexes ==

[[indexing-lucene-numeric-ranges]]
=== Numeric ranges ===

Lucene supports smart indexing of numbers, querying for ranges and sorting such results, and so does its backend for Neo4j.
To mark a value so that it is indexed as a numeric value, we can make use of the http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-lucene-index/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/index/lucene/ValueContext.html[ValueContext] class, like this:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=numericRange
----

[NOTE]
The same type must be used for indexing and querying.
That is, you can't index a value as a Long and then query the index using an Integer.

By giving +null+ as from/to argument, an open ended query is created.
In the following example we are doing that, and have added sorting to the query as well:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=sortedNumericRange
----

From/to in the ranges defaults to be _inclusive_, but you can change this behavior by using two extra parameters:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=exclusiveRange
----


[[indexing-lucene-sort]]
=== Sorting ===

Lucene performs sorting very well, and that is also exposed in the index backend, through the http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-lucene-index/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/index/lucene/QueryContext.html[QueryContext] class:


[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=sortedResult
----

We sort the results by relevance (score) like this:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=queryWithRelevance
----

[[indexing-lucene-query-objects]]
=== Querying with Lucene Query objects ===

Instead of passing in Lucene query syntax queries, you can instantiate such queries programmatically and pass in as argument, for example:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=termQuery
----

Note that the http://lucene.apache.org/java/{lucene-version}/api/core/org/apache/lucene/search/TermQuery.html[TermQuery] is basically the same thing as using the +get+ method on the index.

This is how to perform _wildcard_ searches using Lucene Query Objects:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=wildcardTermQuery
----

Note that this allows for whitespace in the search string.

[[indexing-lucene-compound]]
=== Compound queries ===

Lucene supports querying for multiple terms in the same query, like so:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=compoundQueries
----

CAUTION: Compound queries can't search across committed index entries and those who haven't got committed yet at the same time.

[[indexing-lucene-default-operator]]
=== Default operator ===

The default operator (that is whether +AND+ or +OR+ is used in between different terms) in a query is +OR+. Changing that behavior is also done via the http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-lucene-index/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/index/lucene/QueryContext.html[QueryContext] class:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=defaultOperator
----

[[indexing-lucene-caching]]
=== Caching ===

If your index lookups becomes a performance bottle neck, caching can be enabled for certain keys in certain indexes (key locations) to speed up get requests.
The caching is implemented with an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used[LRU] cache so that only the most recently accessed results are cached (with "results" meaning a query result of a get request, not a single entity).
You can control the size of the cache (the maximum number of results) per index key.

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/ImdbExampleTest.java
tag=cache
----

CAUTION: This setting is not persisted after shutting down the database.
  This means: set this value after each startup of the database if you want to keep it.

[[auto-indexing]]
== Automatic Indexing ==

Neo4j provides a single index for nodes and one for relationships in each database that automatically follow property values as they are added, deleted and changed on database primitives.
This functionality is called _auto indexing_ and is controlled both from the database configuration Map and through its own API.

[[auto-indexing-config]]
=== Configuration ===

By default Auto Indexing is off for both Nodes and Relationships.
To enable it on database startup set the configuration options +Config.NODE_AUTO_INDEXING+
and +Config.RELATIONSHIP_AUTO_INDEXING+ to the string "+true+".

If you just enable auto indexing as above, then still _no_ property will be auto indexed. To define which property names
you want the auto indexer to monitor as a configuration parameter, set the +Config.{NODE,RELATIONSHIP}_KEYS_INDEXABLE+
option to a String that is a comma separated concatenation of the property names you want auto indexed.

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/AutoIndexerExampleTests.java
tag=ConfigAutoIndex
classifier=test-sources
----

[[auto-indexing-api]]
=== Search ===
The usefulness of the auto indexing functionality comes of course from the ability to actually query the index and retrieve results.
To that end, you can acquire a +ReadableIndex+ object from the +AutoIndexer+ that exposes all the query and get methods of a full
http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/index/Index.html[+Index+] with exactly the same functionality.
Continuing from the previous example, accessing the index is done like this:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/AutoIndexerExampleTests.java
tag=APIReadAutoIndex
classifier=test-sources
----

[[auto-indexing-config-api]]
=== Runtime Configuration ===

The same options that are available during database creation via the configuration can also be set during runtime via the +AutoIndexer+ API.

Gaining access to the +AutoIndexer+ API and adding two +Node+ and one +Relationship+ properties to auto index is done like so:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/AutoIndexerExampleTests.java
tag=APIAutoIndexer
classifier=test-sources
----

[[NOTE]]
Parameters to the AutoIndexers passed through the Configuration and settings made through the API are cumulative.
So you can set some beforehand known settings, do runtime checks to augment the initial configuration and then enable the desired auto indexers -
the final configuration is the same regardless of the method used to reach it.


[[auto-indexing-update-removal]]
=== Updating the Automatic Index ===
Updates to the auto indexed properties happen of course automatically as you update them. Removal of properties from the auto index happens for two reasons.
One is that you actually removed the property. The other is that you stopped autoindexing on a property. When the latter happens, any primitive you touch and
it has that property, it is removed from the auto index, regardless of any operations on the property.
When you start or stop auto indexing on a property, no auto update operation happens currently. If you need to change the set of auto indexed properties and
have them re-indexed, you currently have to do this by hand. An example will illustrate the above better:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-lucene-index
source=examples/AutoIndexerExampleTests.java
tag=Mutations
classifier=test-sources
----

[CAUTION]
If you start the database with auto indexing enabled but different auto indexed properties than the last run, then already auto-indexed entities will be deleted
as you work with them. Make sure that the monitored set is what you want before enabling the functionality.
