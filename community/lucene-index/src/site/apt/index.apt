Neo4j Lucene Index

	Integration layer between Neo4j and Lucene, providing one possible implementation
	of the Index API. Implements the <<<IndexProvider>>> extension from the Neo4j kernel
	and provides <<<Index>>> instances with lucene as backend.
    
	This implementation is the default to use as a backend for an index if no provider
	is specified. The provider name is "lucene".
