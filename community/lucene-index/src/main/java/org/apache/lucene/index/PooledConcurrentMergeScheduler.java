/**
 * Lucene indexes merge scheduler that execute merges in a thread pool instead of starting separate thread for each
 * merge. Each writer have it's own scheduler but all of them use shared pool.
 *
 * Current implementation is minimalistic in a number of things it knows about lucene internals to simplify
 * migrations overhead. It wraps up lucene internal merge tasks and execute them in a common thread pool.
 * In case if pool and queue exhausted merge will be performed in callers thread.
 * Since we cant rely on lucene per writer merge threads we need to perform writer tasks counting ourselves to prevent
 * cases while writer will be closed in the middle of merge and will wait for all writer related merges to complete
 * before allowing close of writer scheduler.
