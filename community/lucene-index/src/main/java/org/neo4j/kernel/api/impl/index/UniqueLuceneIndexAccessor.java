    /* The fact that this is here is a sign of a design error, and we should revisit and
         * remove this later on. Specifically, this is here because the unique indexes do validation
         * of uniqueness, which they really shouldn't be doing. In fact, they shouldn't exist, the unique
         * indexes are just indexes, and the logic of how they are used is not the responsibility of the
         * storage system to handle, that should go in the kernel layer.
         *
         * Anyway, where was I.. right: The kernel depends on the unique indexes to handle the business
         * logic of verifying domain uniqueness, and if they did not do that, race conditions appear for
         * index creation (not online operations, note) where concurrent violation of a currently created
         * index may break uniqueness.
         *
         * Phew. So, unique indexes currently have to pick up the slack here. The problem is that while
         * they serve the role of business logic execution, they also happen to be indexes, which is part
         * of the storage layer. There is one golden rule in the storage layer, which must never ever be
         * violated: Operations are idempotent. All operations against the storage layer have to be
         * executable over and over and have the same result, this is the basis of data recovery and
         * system consistency.
         *
         * Clearly, the uniqueness indexes don't do this, and so they fail in fulfilling their primary
         * contract in order to pick up the slack for the kernel not fulfilling it's contract. We hack
         * around this issue by tracking state - we know that probably the only time the idempotent
         * requirement will be invoked is during recovery, and we know that by happenstance, recovery is
         * single-threaded. As such, when we are in recovery, we turn off the business logic part and
         * correctly fulfill our actual contract. As soon as the database is online, we flip back to
         * running business logic in the storage layer and incorrectly implementing the storage layer
         * contract.
         *
         * One day, we should fix this.
