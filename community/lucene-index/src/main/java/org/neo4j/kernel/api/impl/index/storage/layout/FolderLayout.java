 * Component that represent on-disk layout for partitioned lucene index.
 * <p>
 * It's aware how files and partitions located on disk and knows how to map particular partition index into folder.
 * Physically files for index with id <i>indexId</i> will be located in a index root folder indexId with
 * separate sub-folder for each partition.
 * Since each partition is separate lucene index all lucene index files will be located in a corresponding partition
 * folder.
 * <p>
 * As example for index with 3 partitions we will have following directory structure:
 * <pre>
 * ...indexId/
 *    |-- 1
 *    |   `-- partition index files
 *    |-- 2
 *    |   `-- partition index files
 *    |-- 3
 *        `-- partition index files
 * </pre>
