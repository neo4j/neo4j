= Neo4j: The World's Leading Graph Database =

http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] is the world's leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables -- yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.

== Building Neo4j ==

Neo4j is built using http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] version 3.0.x and a recent version of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 7].

The Neo4j Browser module is built using http://nodejs.org[Node.js]. For skipping that part of the build, see below.

* A plain `mvn clean install` will only build the individual jar files. 
* Test execution is, of course, part of the build.
* To add execution of integration tests, use: `mvn clean install -DrunITs`
* In case you just want the jars, without compiling the tests, this is for you: `mvn clean install -DminimalBuild`
* To skip building the browser module, use `-DskipBrowser` (note that you might not be able to build the server without it.)
* To build everything, including running all tests, producing documentation and assembling product packages, use `mvn clean install -DfullBuild`
* To build the documentation see the link:manual/[Neo4j manual]
* When building on Windows, use `-Dlicensing.skip` to avoid problems related to line endings.
* The license header check can be skipped by appending the following to the command line: `-Dlicense.skip=true`

== Licensing ==

Neo4j is an open source product. We support a Community edition under the GPLv3 license. The Enterprise edition is available under the AGPLv3 license for open source projects otherwise under a commercial license from http://info.neotechnology.com/contactus.html[Neo Technology].
