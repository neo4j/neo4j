= Neo4j: Graphs for Everyone =

https://neo4j.com[Neo4j] is the world's leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables -- yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.

== Using Neo4j ==

Neo4j is available both as a standalone server, or an embeddable component. You can https://neo4j.com/download/[download] or http://console.neo4j.org[try online].

== Extending Neo4j ==

We encourage experimentation with Neo4j. You can build extensions to Neo4j, develop library or drivers atop the product, or make contributions directly to the product core. You'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement in order for us to accept your patches.

NOTE: This GitHub repository contains mixed GPL and AGPL code. Our Community edition (in the link:community/[community/] directory) is GPLv3. Our Enterprise edition (link:enterprise/[enterprise/]) is differently licensed under the AGPLv3 with the Commons Clause.

== Dependencies ==

Neo4j is built using http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] version 3.3 and a recent version of supported VM. Bash and Make are also required. Note that maven needs more memory than the standard configuration, this can be achieved with `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

OS X users need to have http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] installed.

=== With brew on OS X ===

  brew install maven

Please note that we do not support building Debian packages on OS X.

=== With apt-get on Ubuntu ===

  apt install maven openjdk-8-jdk

On top of that, to build Debian packages and Neo4j Desktop:

  apt install debhelper devscripts dos2unix dpkg make xmlstarlet
  # You will need a license for install4j, which is only needed for Neo4j Desktop
  curl -O http://download-keycdn.ej-technologies.com/install4j/install4j_linux_6_1_4.deb
  dpkg -i install4j_linux_6_1_4.deb

== Building Neo4j ==

Before you start running the unit and integration tests in the Neo4j Maven project on a Linux-like system, you should ensure your limit on open files is set to a reasonable value. You can test it with `ulimit -n`. We recommend you have a limit of at least 40K.

* A plain `mvn clean install` will only build the individual jar files.
* Test execution is, of course, part of the build.
* In case you just want the jars, without running tests, this is for you: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.
* To build product packages, do `export PATH="bin:$PATH" && make clean all` in the packaging directory after building artifacts with Maven.
* To build the documentation see the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-documentation/[Neo4j documentation].
* If you are running into problems building on Windows you can try building Neo4j in a Ubuntu virtual machine.
* You may need to increase the memory available to Maven: `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

== Running Neo4j ==

After running a `mvn clean install` cd into `packaging/standalone/target` and extract the version you want, then

  bin/neo4j start

in the extracted folder to start Neo4j on `localhost:7474`. On Windows you want to run

  bin\neo4j start

instead.

Or, if you are not interested in the tarballs and just want to run Neo4j you can instead run a `mvn clean install -DminimalBuild` and then cd into `community/server` and run

  mvn clean compile exec:java

to start Neo4j.
