You are free to share and to remix it remix under the following conditions:

	* You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author (SEE
	BELOW).

You're free to use these icons for commercial and non-commercial purposes, for
yourself, your company and your clients, and to edit, remix and otherwise modify
them, as long as clear attribution is provided. You may not sell or redistribute
the icons themselves as icons.

Additionally, you may not use them in a way that encourages downstream
distribution -- no templates or skins or theme kits or similar uses, no
app-building tools or similar. (The person using the theme or template might not
know where the icons came from and thus wouldn't be following the license.) This
specifically prohibits the use in any kind of "app builder" tool or platform,
especially where the icons are provided as choices to people using the tool to
create apps.

ATTRIBUTION -- A note on your app's website, like "Icons by Glyphish" or
similar, plus a link back to glyphish.com, is the preferred form of attribution.
For questions about attribution, contact me via the Glyphish website.

USE WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION -- If attribution is not possible, workable or desirable
for your application, get in touch to discuss other options.
