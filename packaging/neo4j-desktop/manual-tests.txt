 * Get a clean Windows box that hasn't had Neo4j installed before.
 * Download latest Windows installer from the
   neo4j-2.0-release-candidate build.
 * Run the installer, allowing it to start Desktop at the end.
 * Start the default database.
 * Launch the browser by clicking the link in Desktop.
 * Insert some data through the browser and check that you can
   retrieve it.
 * Stop the database and close Desktop.
 * Open Desktop and restart the same database, check that you can see
   the data you created.
 * Stop the database.
 * In Desktop open the browse dialogue and use it to create a new
   empty folder. Open that folder as a database.
 * Check that you can't see the data you added to the other database.
 * Change the server port through the settings dialogue. Check that
   the browser can now connect to the new port.
 * Through settings dialogue, add read_only=true to neo4j.properties.
 * Check that you get an error if you try to modify data.
 * Restart the original, default database and check that you can still
   modify data.
 * Install a plugin or extension. For example, download Neo4j Spatial(1)
   and drop it in the right place(2).
 * Uninstall Desktop. Check that Program Files\Neo4j Community is
   deleted, but directories under Application Data and My Documents
   remain.
