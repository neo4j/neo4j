# Memory Settings
#********************************************************************
#
# Memory settings are specified kibibytes with the 'k' suffix, mebibytes with
# 'm' and gibibytes with 'g'.
# If Neo4j is running on a dedicated server, then it is generally recommended
# to leave about 2-4 gigabytes for the operating system, give the JVM enough
# heap to hold all your transaction state and query context, and then leave the
# rest for the page cache.

# Java Heap Size: by default the Java heap size is dynamically calculated based
# on available system resources. Uncomment these lines to set specific initial
# and maximum heap size.
#server.memory.heap.initial_size=512m
#server.memory.heap.max_size=512m

# The amount of memory to use for mapping the store files.
# The default page cache memory assumes the machine is dedicated to running
# Neo4j, and is heuristically set to 50% of RAM minus the Java heap size.
#server.memory.pagecache.size=10g

# Limit the amount of memory that all of the running transaction can consume.
# The default value is 70% of the heap size limit.
#dbms.memory.transaction.total.max=256m

# Limit the amount of memory that a single transaction can consume.
# By default there is no limit.
#db.memory.transaction.max=16m

#*****************************************************************
# Network connector configuration
#*****************************************************************

# With default configuration Neo4j only accepts local connections.
# To accept non-local connections, uncomment this line:
#server.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

# You can also choose a specific network interface, and configure a non-default
# port for each connector, by setting their individual listen_address.

# The address at which this server can be reached by its clients. This may be the server's IP address or DNS name, or
# it may be the address of a reverse proxy which sits in front of the server. This setting may be overridden for
# individual connectors below.
#server.default_advertised_address=localhost

# You can also choose a specific advertised hostname or IP address, and
# configure an advertised port for each connector, by setting their
# individual advertised_address.

# By default, encryption is turned off.
# To turn on encryption, an ssl policy for the connector needs to be configured
# Read more in SSL policy section in this file for how to define a SSL policy.

# Bolt connector

#*****************************************************************
# SSL policy configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Each policy is configured under a separate namespace, e.g.
#    dbms.ssl.policy.<scope>.*
#    <scope> can be any of 'bolt', 'https', 'cluster' or 'backup'
#
# The scope is the name of the component where the policy will be used
# Each component where the use of an ssl policy is desired needs to declare at least one setting of the policy.
# Allowable values are 'bolt', 'https', 'cluster' or 'backup'.

# E.g if bolt and https connectors should use the same policy, the following could be declared
#   dbms.ssl.policy.bolt.base_directory=certificates/default
#   dbms.ssl.policy.https.base_directory=certificates/default
# However, it's strongly encouraged to not use the same key pair for multiple scopes.
#
# N.B: Note that a connector must be configured to support/require
#      SSL/TLS for the policy to actually be utilized.
#
# see: dbms.connector.*.tls_level

# SSL settings (dbms.ssl.policy.<scope>.*)
#  .base_directory       Base directory for SSL policies paths. All relative paths within the
#                        SSL configuration will be resolved from the base dir.
#
#  .private_key          A path to the key file relative to the '.base_directory'.
#
#  .private_key_password The password for the private key.
#
#  .public_certificate   A path to the public certificate file relative to the '.base_directory'.
#
#  .trusted_dir          A path to a directory containing trusted certificates.
#
#  .revoked_dir          Path to the directory with Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
#
#  .verify_hostname      If true, the server will verify the hostname that the client uses to connect with. In order
#                        for this to work, the server public certificate must have a valid CN and/or matching
#                        Subject Alternative Names.
#
#  .client_auth          How the client should be authorized. Possible values are: 'none', 'optional', 'require'.
#
#  .tls_versions         A comma-separated list of allowed TLS versions. By default only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are allowed.
#
#  .trust_all            Setting this to 'true' will ignore the trust truststore, trusting all clients and servers.
#                        Use of this mode is discouraged. It would offer encryption but no security.
#
#  .ciphers              A comma-separated list of allowed ciphers. The default ciphers are the defaults of
#                        the JVM platform.
