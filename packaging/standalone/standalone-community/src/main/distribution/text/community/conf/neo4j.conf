# This setting constrains all `LOAD CSV` import files to be under the `import` directory. Remove or comment it out to
# allow files to be loaded from anywhere in the filesystem; this introduces possible security problems. See the
# `LOAD CSV` section of the manual for details.

# Whether requests to Neo4j are authenticated.
# To disable authentication, uncomment this line

# Java Heap Size: by default the Java heap size is dynamically
# calculated based on available system resources.
# Uncomment these lines to set specific initial and maximum
# heap size.
#dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=512m
#dbms.memory.heap.max_size=512m

# The amount of memory to use for mapping the store files, in bytes (or
# kilobytes with the 'k' suffix, megabytes with 'm' and gigabytes with 'g').
# If Neo4j is running on a dedicated server, then it is generally recommended
# to leave about 2-4 gigabytes for the operating system, give the JVM enough
# heap to hold all your transaction state and query context, and then leave the
# rest for the page cache.
# The default page cache memory assumes the machine is dedicated to running
# Neo4j, and is heuristically set to 50% of RAM minus the max Java heap size.
#dbms.memory.pagecache.size=10g

#*****************************************************************
# Network connector configuration
#*****************************************************************

# With default configuration Neo4j only accepts local connections.
# To accept non-local connections, uncomment this line:
#dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

# You can also choose a specific network interface, and configure a non-default
# port for each connector, by setting their individual listen_address.

# The address at which this server can be reached by its clients. This may be the server's IP address or DNS name, or
# it may be the address of a reverse proxy which sits in front of the server. This setting may be overridden for
# individual connectors below.
#dbms.connectors.default_advertised_address=localhost

# You can also choose a specific advertised hostname or IP address, and
# configure an advertised port for each connector, by setting their
# individual advertised_address.

# Bolt connector
dbms.connector.bolt.enabled=true
#dbms.connector.bolt.tls_level=OPTIONAL

#*****************************************************************
# SSL system configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Names of the SSL policies to be used for the respective components.

# The legacy policy is a special policy which is not defined in
# the policy configuration section, but rather derives from
# dbms.directories.certificates and associated files
# (by default: neo4j.key and neo4j.cert). Its use will be deprecated.

# The policies to be used for connectors.
#
# N.B: Note that a connector must be configured to support/require
#      SSL/TLS for the policy to actually be utilized.
#
# see: dbms.connector.*.tls_level

#bolt.ssl_policy=legacy
#https.ssl_policy=legacy

#*****************************************************************
# SSL policy configuration
#*****************************************************************

# Each policy is configured under a separate namespace, e.g.
#    dbms.ssl.policy.<policyname>.*
#
# The example settings below are for a new policy named 'default'.

# The base directory for cryptographic objects. Each policy will by
# default look for its associated objects (keys, certificates, ...)
# under the base directory.
#
# Every such setting can be overriden using a full path to
# the respective object, but every policy will by default look
# for cryptographic objects in its base location.
#
# Mandatory setting

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.base_directory=certificates/default

# Allows the generation of a fresh private key and a self-signed
# certificate if none are found in the expected locations. It is
# recommended to turn this off again after keys have been generated.
#
# Keys should in general be generated and distributed offline
# by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and not by utilizing
# this mode.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.allow_key_generation=false

# Enabling this makes it so that this policy ignores the contents
# of the trusted_dir and simply resorts to trusting everything.
#
# Use of this mode is discouraged. It would offer encryption but no security.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.trust_all=false

# The private key for the default SSL policy. By default a file
# named private.key is expected under the base directory of the policy.
# It is mandatory that a key can be found or generated.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.private_key=

# The private key for the default SSL policy. By default a file
# named public.crt is expected under the base directory of the policy.
# It is mandatory that a certificate can be found or generated.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.public_certificate=

# The certificates of trusted parties. By default a directory named
# 'trusted' is expected under the base directory of the policy. It is
# mandatory to create the directory so that it exists, because it cannot
# be auto-created (for security purposes).
#
# To enforce client authentication client_auth must be set to 'require'!

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.trusted_dir=

# Client authentication setting. Values: none, optional, require
# The default is to require client authentication.
#
# Servers are always authenticated unless explicitly overridden
# using the trust_all setting. In a mutual authentication setup this
# should be kept at the default of require and trusted certificates
# must be installed in the trusted_dir.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.client_auth=require

# A comma-separated list of allowed TLS versions.
# By default only TLSv1.2 is allowed.

#dbms.ssl.policy.default.tls_versions=

# A comma-separated list of allowed ciphers.
# The default ciphers are the defaults of the JVM platform.

# Value of the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) response header. This header
# tells browsers that a webpage should only be accessed using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

# cache leads to an increase in mean IO response time.
# Try reducing the heap memory, if this flag degrades performance.
