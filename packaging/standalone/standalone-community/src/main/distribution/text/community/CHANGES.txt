For Release Notes, see http://neo4j.org/release-notes

1.9.M03 (2012-12-21)
--------------------
Server:
o Pulled out Gremlin as separate plugin to support different versions

Cypher:
o Fixes #336 - Patterns that re-use a pattern node can produce non-existing matches
o Fixes #369 - The substring-function sometimes fails when no length is specified

1.9.M02 (2012-11-30)
--------------------
Kernel:
o Made sure that auto-indexing removed graph elements from indexes when they are delete
o OrderByTypeExpander keeps ordering of type AND direction
o Fixed an issue where a lock on a store was sometimes not released
o Old GraphDatabaseSetting classes are now wrappers for Settings instances
o Fixes an issue where an incomplete 2PC transaction could cause recovery to not be triggered
o Optimizations for read performance
  - Cache refers to relationship types as ints instead of Strings.
  - Binary search on sorted arrays for finding properties and
    relationship types in the cache.
  - Less objects instantiated during getting and iterating relationships.
  - Reduced number of map lookups significantly for a getProperty call,
    especially outside transaction or in transactions without any changes.
    (previously 8 lookups whereof 2 synchronized, now down to as low as 2)
  - Uses ThreadLocal as mapper from thread to transaction
  - Refactored LockReleaser into TransactionState, associated with each
    transaction instead

Server:
o Server now allows - under some specific circumstances - setting empty arrays as properties. 
  Specifically, it is allowed if there is a pre-existing array property on the entity from 
  which the server can infer the type of array to store.
o Traversal Javascript is now security sandboxed. It is possible to turn the sandbox off for
  the next two releases, for backwards compatibility.

Cypher:
o The traversal pattern matcher now supports variable length relationship patterns
o Fixes #946 - HAS(...) fails with ThisShouldNotHappenException for some patterns
o Made Cypher better at keeping a numeric type. Adding two integers now returns an integer, and not a double.
o Major refactoring to make certain Cypher is more lazy
o When asking for the top x rows by some value, Cypher will now only keep a list the size of x
o Fix so identifiers created inside a foreach can be used by other statements in the foreach
o Fix for problems when using patterns with multiple unnamed nodes
o Fixes problems when doing ORDER BY ... LIMIT x. When x is larger than the input set, sorting was never done.

1.9.M01 (2012-10-23)
--------------------
Kernel:
o XaDatasources now implement lifecycle and their registration with XaDatasourceManager triggers TxManager recovery
  on startup.
o Neo4j logical log now handles running out of disk space at a critical point gracefully.
o Kernel extensions are now factories that create instances which participate in the database's lifecycle
o Fixes a race condition around relationship chain loading from multiple threads on the same node

Cypher:
o Predicates can now be returned and used to set properties
o Fixes #797: CREATE UNIQUE now makes sure used identifiers have the same properties even if
  they are re-used without the properties
o Added the traversal matcher, which uses the new traversal framework abilities to do
  pattern matching. It should provide for nice performance benefits for a lot of queries.
o Fixed #866: Changed the LRU cache to make it safe to use concurrently, and made the parser single threaded
o Added the reduce() functionality
o Made addition automatically convert numbers to strings when adding the two together
o Added the string functions: str(), replace(), substring(), left(), right(), ltrim(), rtrim(), trim(), lower(), upper()
o Added the possibility to use ORDER BY, SKIP and LIMIT together with WITH
o Fixes #904: CREATE UNIQUE doesn't work with parameter maps
o Fixes #908: Parameters do not survive WITH if it has aggregation
o SET can now be used to set properties on nodes and relationships from maps or other graph elements

1.8.RC1 (2012-09-05)
--------------------
Kernel:
 o Removed contention around allocating and moving persistence windows so that a thread won't need to await
   another thread doing this refresh, instead just continue knowing that the windows will be optimally
   placed in a very near future.
 o Removed contention around translating a key (as String) into the ID by using copy-on-write map instead
   of a concurrent hash map. Used in property key as well as relationship type translation.
 o Fix for Node/Relationship#getPropertyValues() sometimes returning null values from the iterator.

Server:
 o Upgraded Jackson JAXRS to version 1.9.7 
 o Keeping the Cypher execution engine between calls makes it possible to re-use execution plans
 o added User-Agent header tracking to udc to determine rest-driver usage

Cypher:
 o Removed the /../ literal for regular expressions. Now a normal string literal is used instead
 o Concatenation handles types better
 o Changed how the graph-matching module is used, to make it safe for concurrent use
 o Better type error messages
 o Renamed iterable to collection
 o Fixed #795: so that WITH keeps parameters also for empty aggregation results
 o Fixed #772: Creating nodes/relationships goes before SET, so SET can run on already created elements
 o Added error when using != instead of <>
 o Fixed #787: Issue when comparing array properties with literal collections
 o Fixed #751: Better error message for some type errors
 o Fixed #818: Problem where properties could only have scalar values (they can be arrays as well)
 o Fixed #834: Gives relevant syntax exception when properties are entered in MATCH

1.8.M07 (2012-08-08)
--------------------
Kernel:
 o Traversal framework backwards compatibility
   + Cleaned up any breaking changes
   + Removed Expander#addFilter

 o Fixes #625: Values passed through WITH have the wrong type
 o Fixes #654: Some paths are returned the wrong way

1.8.M05 (2012-06-25)
--------------------
Kernel:
 o Configurable amount of logical logs to keep, by for example number of days or size on disk.
   keep_logical_logs configuration is extended to support values such as: "10 days", "200M size" a.s.o.
   Regardless of configuration there will always be at least the latest non-empty logical log left.
 o Reduced synchronization while memory mapping files, leading to increased multithreaded performance

Server:
 o Added support for multi line Cypher queries in webadmin browser

Lucene-index:
o Removed lucene_writers_cache_size and have lucene_searcher_cache_size decide for both, since
  it's doesn't make sense to have a writer w/o a searcher and isn't possible to have a searcher
  w/o its writer.
o Loosened contention regarding getting index searchers for querying.

Cypher:
 o CREATE and RELATE can now introduce path identifiers
 o String literals can now contain escape characters
 o Fixes #600: Double optional with no matching relationships returns too many rows
 o Fixes #613: Missing dependencies not reported correctly for queries with RELATE/SET/DELETE
 o Fixes around optional paths

1.8.M04 (2012-06-07)
--------------------
Kernel:
 o Additions to the traversal framework:
   + Bidirectional traversals (with BidirectionalTraversalDescription). AllPaths/AllSimplePaths
     uses this feature and are now faster due to less relationships being traversed.
   + Multiple start nodes (as well as multiple end nodes for bidirectional traversals).
   + PathExpander (RelationshipExpander for Paths) which has the full Path passed in instead of
     just the end node of the path. It can also see and modify a user defined traversal branch state.
   + Metadata about the traversal, for the time being: number of relationships traversal and
     number paths returned.
   + Added Path#reverseNodes() and Path#reverseRelationships which gives all nodes/relationships in
    a path in reverse order (starting from the end node going back to the start node). More relevant
  	in many scenarios as well as allowing for a more efficient implementation.
   + Sorting of traversal results, specify with TraversalDescription#sort(Comparable).
   + Some measure to reduce memory consumption and garbage generation during traversals.

Graph-algo:
 o AllPaths/AllSimplePaths uses the new bidirectional traversal feature in the traversal framework.
  Less relationships now needs to be traversed to find the requested paths.
 o Added an implementation of the shortest path algorithm with the bidirectional traversal feature.

 o Path patterns can now be used as expressions and as predicates
 o Fixes bug where RELATE fails to compare array properties
 o Fixes #573: Arithmetics operations have wrong type
 o Fixes #567: Parameter maps coming through REST are not parsed correctly

--------------------
Kernel:
 o Changed array map to CHM in property index manager, better multithreaded performance
Shell:
 o Added BEGIN TRANSACTION/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
 o Sessions now live on the server side instead of on the client, which means that not just
  serializable values can be set there. Paves the way for Cypher making use of it.
Server:
 o keep_logical_logs is now respected if set to false - default is still true
Cypher:
 o Added RELATE
 o Changed the CREATE syntax, so it looks more like RELATE

--------------------
o Byte array properties are handled in a more optimized way, increasing performance by a couple of times at least.
o Fix for an issue where update of cache when creating a relationship on a very dense node would take longer and longer time.
o Fix for an issue where a recovery would sometimes fail with it reporting that a start record already had been injected.

o Fix for an issue where a full rebuild of an id generator (rebuild_idgenerators_fast=false) could result
  in exception when adding free ids.
o Fix for issue which would close an id generator as clean if a startup failed at the wrong time, which would make
  the id generator diverge from the store it held ids for and possible truncate that store file the next clean shutdown.

Shell:
  o dbinfo command now able to print simple values as well as arrays and compound values as JSON output.
  o A shell server which isn't remotely avaiable doesn't touch RMI, neither does a client which connects
    to a server within the same JVM. This makes for less RMI garbage when forgetting to call shutdown().
  o Fixes problem with eval command in that it couldn't execute a single-line command, which made it impossible
    to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside
UDC:
  o Added MAC address to pings.

  Request header (max-execution-time) can shorten it if specified.
o Fixed issues #113, #166, #172
o Allow overriding of server base url for when test browser needs to access server via a different hostname from the bind address.
o Exposes get-or-create-uniquely via REST in ex. POST /index/node/<name>?unique {...}
o Added shell command mknode for creating new nodes w/o creating a relationship.

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)

o [kernel] Fixed a race condition in the property cache which cuold poison the cache.
o [kernel] Fixed an issue where a JVM crash in the wrong place would make the next startup rename the current logical log without
  incrementing the logVersion, making the next log rename fail.
o [kernel] Start records in the logical log aren't written until the transaction starts preparing/committing. This fixes an issue
  with the logical log not being rotated sometimes.
o [kernel] Added AbstractGraphDatabase#tx() which returns a TransactionBuilder possible of configuring the transaction to be "unforced"
  meaning that logical logs won't be forced when committing. Means better performance for small non-critical transactions.
o [kernel] Reduced number of proxy object instantiation and node record loading in general.
o [kernel] Added a wrapping graphdb abstraction, which makes instances survive even if the underlying db restarts.
o [kernel] Detached LogExtractor from XaLogicaLog so that it can be used without having a db running.

1.6.M01 (2011-11-24)
--------------------
o ImpermantentGraphDatabase now uses purely in-memory structures for speed during tests. It's done on a FileChannel level
  so that every other aspect of the database is intact, just that the bytes end up in ByteBuffers instead of files.
o Fixed an issue with evaluators not executing correctly for the start node of a traversal.
o Fixed an issue with BufferOverflowException thrown sometimes during extraction of prepared transactions.
o Added graph properties, i.e. properties that belongs to the graph itself as opposed to a specific node or relationship.
  Useful for extensions which would like to store configuration and what not.
o Better multi-line support in shell, as well as case insensitive app names.
o GraphDatabaseService#getAllNodes and #getRelationshipTypes @Deprecated and moved to GlobalGraphOperations class,
  where also #getAllRelationships is implemented.
o Added LRU cache for open indexes so that a limit can be set. Thanks vivekprahlad (github id) for the patch.
o When using ImpermanentGraphDatabase RAMDirectory is used instead of FSDirectory. Useful for speed during testing.

o [STORE FORMAT CHANGE] New layout of the property store(s) which results in roughly a 30% reduction in size on disk as well as fewer I/O read operations for reading properties.
o Significant performance improvements for extracting transactions from logical logs.
o Lots of new Cypher features, f.ex: path functions, parameters, shortest path function.
o Icons in the visualization in webadmin and added a standalone webadmin mode.

o Improved memory footprint and read performance.
o A weak reference cache is now available for high load low latency workloads.
o The old index API has been deprecated (but still included and have been updated to use Lucene version 3.0.1).
o There is a new index API based on Lucene supporting multiple indexes both for nodes and relationships.
o Path algos can now be performed using the shell.

o All known bugs have been fixed. For more details see the individual milestone releases below.

1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
--------------------

- Kernel
o Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
  PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
o Added logging of recovery completion.
o Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
  the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
  lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

- Shell
o Fixed a problem where ShellServerExtension assumed the shell was enabled during shutdown, which could result in NPE.

- Lucene-index
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).
o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.
o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.

- HA
o When a new master is chosen, slaves throws away the id allocations they got from the previous master. This fixes a problem where occupied ids where reused.
o Enabled (and fixed problem with) thread on master which checks for dead slave connections and rolls back those transactions, so that their locks are released.
  This fixes a problem where an HA cluster would seem to freeze up and become unresponsive to write requests.
o Adding Log4j and Netty license information.
o Also closes the executor containing the connections.
o Changed dependency scopes.
o Shuts down databases after verifying them.

- Server
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
