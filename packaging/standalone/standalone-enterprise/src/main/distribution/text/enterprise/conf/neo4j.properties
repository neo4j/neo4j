# Enable this to be able to upgrade a store from an older version.
#allow_store_upgrade=true

# The amount of memory to use for mapping the store files, either in bytes or
# as a percentage of available memory. This will be clipped at the amount of
# free memory observed when the database starts, and automatically be rounded
# down to the nearest whole page. For example, if "500MB" is configured, but
# only 450MB of memory is free when the database starts, then the database will
# map at most 450MB. If "50%" is configured, and the system has a capacity of
# 4GB, then at most 2GB of memory will be mapped, unless the database observes
# that less than 2GB of memory is free when it starts.
#dbms.pagecache.memory=50%

# Enable this to specify a parser other than the default one.
#cypher_parser_version=2.0

# Keep logical logs, helps debugging but uses more disk space, enabled for
# legacy reasons To limit space needed to store historical logs use values such
# as: "7 days" or "100M size" instead of "true".
#keep_logical_logs=7 days

# Autoindexing

# Enable auto-indexing for nodes, default is false.
#node_auto_indexing=true

# The node property keys to be auto-indexed, if enabled.
#node_keys_indexable=name,age

# Enable auto-indexing for relationships, default is false.
#relationship_auto_indexing=true

# The relationship property keys to be auto-indexed, if enabled.
#relationship_keys_indexable=name,age

# Enable shell server so that remote clients can connect via Neo4j shell.
#remote_shell_enabled=true
# The network interface IP the shell will listen on (use 0.0.0 for all interfaces).
#remote_shell_host=127.0.0.1
# The port the shell will listen on, default is 1337.
#remote_shell_port=1337

# The type of cache to use for nodes and relationships.
#cache_type=hpc

# Maximum size of the heap memory to dedicate to the cached nodes.
#node_cache_size=

# Maximum size of the heap memory to dedicate to the cached relationships.

# Enable online backups to be taken from this database.
online_backup_enabled=true

# Port to listen to for incoming backup requests.

# ha.server_id is the number of each instance in the HA cluster. It should be
# an integer (e.g. 1), and should be unique for each cluster instance.
#ha.server_id=

# ha.initial_hosts is a comma-separated list (without spaces) of the host:port
# where the ha.cluster_server of all instances will be listening. Typically
# this will be the same for all cluster instances.
#ha.initial_hosts=192.168.0.1:5001,192.168.0.2:5001,192.168.0.3:5001

# IP and port for this instance to listen on, for communicating cluster status
# information iwth other instances (also see ha.initial_hosts). The IP
# must be the configured IP address for one of the local interfaces.
#ha.cluster_server=192.168.0.1:5001

# IP and port for this instance to listen on, for communicating transaction
# data with other instances (also see ha.initial_hosts). The IP
# must be the configured IP address for one of the local interfaces.
#ha.server=192.168.0.1:6001

# The interval at which slaves will pull updates from the master. Comment out
# the option to disable periodic pulling of updates. Unit is seconds.
ha.pull_interval=10

# Amount of slaves the master will try to push a transaction to upon commit
# (default is 1). The master will optimistically continue and not fail the
# transaction even if it fails to reach the push factor. Setting this to 0 will
# increase write performance when writing through master but could potentially
# lead to branched data (or loss of transaction) if the master goes down.
#ha.tx_push_factor=1

# Strategy the master will use when pushing data to slaves (if the push factor
# is greater than 0). There are two options available "fixed" (default) or
# "round_robin". Fixed will start by pushing to slaves ordered by server id
# (highest first) improving performance since the slaves only have to cache up
# one transaction at a time.
#ha.tx_push_strategy=fixed

# Policy for how to handle branched data.
#branched_data_policy=keep_all

# Clustering timeouts
# Default timeout.
#ha.default_timeout=5s

# How often heartbeat messages should be sent. Defaults to ha.default_timeout.
#ha.heartbeat_interval=5s

# Timeout for heartbeats between cluster members. Should be at least twice that of ha.heartbeat_interval.
#heartbeat_timeout=11s
