# Enable this to be able to upgrade a store from an older version.
#allow_store_upgrade=true

# The amount of memory to use for mapping the store files, in bytes (or
# kilobytes with the 'k' suffix, megabytes with 'm' and gigabytes with 'g').
# If Neo4j is running on a dedicated server, then it is generally recommended
# to leave about 2-4 gigabytes for the operating system, give the JVM enough
# heap to hold all your transaction state and query context, and then leave the
# rest for the page cache.
# The default page cache memory assumes the machine is dedicated to running
# Neo4j, and is heuristically set to 50% of RAM minus the max Java heap size.
#dbms.pagecache.memory=10g

# Enable this to specify a parser other than the default one.
#cypher_parser_version=2.0

# Set the root directory for use with file URLs (`file:///`) in LOAD CSV.
# If enabled, file URLs will refer to locations inside the `data/import`
# directory. I.e. `file:///movies/actors.csv` will load from the file
# `data/import/movies/actors.csv`.
#dbms.security.load_csv_file_url_root=data/import

# Keep logical logs, helps debugging but uses more disk space, enabled for
# legacy reasons To limit space needed to store historical logs use values such
# as: "7 days" or "100M size" instead of "true".
#keep_logical_logs=7 days

# Enable shell server so that remote clients can connect via Neo4j shell.
#remote_shell_enabled=true
# The network interface IP the shell will listen on (use 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces).
#remote_shell_host=127.0.0.1
# The port the shell will listen on, default is 1337.
#remote_shell_port=1337

# Enable online backups to be taken from this database.
online_backup_enabled=true

# Port to listen to for incoming backup requests.
online_backup_server=127.0.0.1:6362

# ha.server_id is the number of each instance in the HA cluster. It should be
# an integer (e.g. 1), and should be unique for each cluster instance.
#ha.server_id=

# ha.initial_hosts is a comma-separated list (without spaces) of the host:port
# where the ha.cluster_server of all instances will be listening. Typically
# this will be the same for all cluster instances.
#ha.initial_hosts=192.168.0.1:5001,192.168.0.2:5001,192.168.0.3:5001

# IP and port for this instance to listen on, for communicating cluster status
# information iwth other instances (also see ha.initial_hosts). The IP
# must be the configured IP address for one of the local interfaces.
#ha.cluster_server=192.168.0.1:5001

# IP and port for this instance to listen on, for communicating transaction
# data with other instances (also see ha.initial_hosts). The IP
# must be the configured IP address for one of the local interfaces.

# The interval at which slaves will pull updates from the master. Comment out
# the option to disable periodic pulling of updates. Unit is seconds.
ha.pull_interval=10

# Amount of slaves the master will try to push a transaction to upon commit
# (default is 1). The master will optimistically continue and not fail the
# transaction even if it fails to reach the push factor. Setting this to 0 will
# increase write performance when writing through master but could potentially
# lead to branched data (or loss of transaction) if the master goes down.
#ha.tx_push_factor=1

# Strategy the master will use when pushing data to slaves (if the push factor
# is greater than 0). There are three options available "fixed_descending" (default),
# "fixed_ascending" or "round_robin". Fixed strategies will start by pushing to
# slaves ordered by server id (accordingly with qualifier) and are useful when
# planning for a stable fail-over based on ids.
#ha.tx_push_strategy=fixed_descending

# Policy for how to handle branched data.
#branched_data_policy=keep_all

# Clustering timeouts
# Default timeout.
#ha.default_timeout=5s

# How often heartbeat messages should be sent. Defaults to ha.default_timeout.
#ha.heartbeat_interval=5s

# Timeout for heartbeats between cluster members. Should be at least twice that of ha.heartbeat_interval.
#heartbeat_timeout=11s
