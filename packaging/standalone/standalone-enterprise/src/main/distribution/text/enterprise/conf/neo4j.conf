# LDAP Authentication Configuration

# documentation for more details.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.mechanism=simple

# LDAP user DN template. An LDAP object is referenced by its distinguished name (DN), and a user DN is
# an LDAP fully-qualified unique user identifier. This setting is used to generate an LDAP DN that
# conforms with the LDAP directory's schema from the user principal that is submitted with the
# authentication token when logging in.
# The special token {0} is a placeholder where the user principal will be substituted into the DN string.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

# Determines if the result of authentication via the LDAP server should be cached or not.
# Caching is used to limit the number of LDAP requests that have to be made over the network
# for users that have already been authenticated successfully. A user can be authenticated against
# an existing cache entry (instead of via an LDAP server) as long as it is alive
# (see `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`).
# An important consequence of setting this to `true` is that
# Neo4j then needs to cache a hashed version of the credentials in order to perform credentials
# matching. This hashing is done using a cryptographic hash function together with a random salt.
# Preferably a conscious decision should be made if this method is considered acceptable by
# the security standards of the organization in which this Neo4j instance is deployed.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled=true

#----------------------------------
# LDAP Authorization Configuration
#----------------------------------
# Authorization is performed by searching the directory for the groups that
# the user is a member of, and then map those groups to Neo4j roles.

# Perform LDAP search for authorization info using a system account instead of the user's own account.
#
# If this is set to `false` (default), the search for group membership will be performed
# directly after authentication using the LDAP context bound with the user's own account.
# The mapped roles will be cached for the duration of `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`,
# and then expire, requiring re-authentication. To avoid frequently having to re-authenticate
# sessions you may want to set a relatively long auth cache expiration time together with this option.
# NOTE: This option will only work if the users are permitted to search for their
# own group membership attributes in the directory.
#
# If this is set to `true`, the search will be performed using a special system account user
# with read access to all the users in the directory.
# You need to specify the username and password using the settings
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username` and
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password` with this option.
# Note that this account only needs read access to the relevant parts of the LDAP directory

# Limit the number of IOs the background checkpoint process will consume per second.

# An IO is in this case a 8 KiB (mostly sequential) write. Limiting the write IO in
# this way will leave more bandwidth in the IO subsystem to service random-read IOs,
# which is important for the response time of queries when the database cannot fit
# entirely in memory. The only drawback of this setting is that longer checkpoint times
# may lead to slightly longer recovery times in case of a database or system crash.
# A lower number means lower IO pressure, and consequently longer checkpoint times.
# The configuration can also be commented out to remove the limitation entirely, and
# let the checkpointer flush data as fast as the hardware will go.
# Set this to -1 to disable the IOPS limit.

# Make sure that `initmemory` is not only allocated, but committed to
