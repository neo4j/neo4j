# ha.server_id is the number of each instance in the HA cluster. It should be

# where the ha.cluster_server of all instances will be listening. Typically
# this will be the same for all cluster instances.

# Amount of slaves the master will try to push a transaction to upon commit
# (default is 1). The master will optimistically continue and not fail the

# increase write performance when writing through master but could potentially
# lead to branched data (or loss of transaction) if the master goes down.
#ha.tx_push_factor=1

# Strategy the master will use when pushing data to slaves (if the push factor
# is greater than 0). There are three options available "fixed_ascending" (default),
# "fixed_descending" or "round_robin". Fixed strategies will start by pushing to
# slaves ordered by server id (accordingly with qualifier) and are useful when
# planning for a stable fail-over based on ids.
