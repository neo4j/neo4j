#ha.initial_hosts=127.0.0.1:5001,127.0.0.1:5002,127.0.0.1:5003

# How long to wait for heartbeats from other instances before marking them as suspects for failure.
# This value reflects considerations of network latency, expected duration of garbage collection pauses

#dbms.security.auth_cache_max_capacity=10000

# Set to log successful authentication events to the security log.

# could be useful if you find that the successful events spam the logs too much,
# and you do not require full auditing capability.
#dbms.security.log_successful_authentication=true

#================================================
# LDAP Auth Provider Configuration
#================================================

# URL of LDAP server (with protocol, hostname and port) to use for authentication and authorization.
# If no protocol is specified the default will be `ldap://`.
# To use LDAPS, set the protocol and port, e.g. `ldaps://ldap.example.com:636`
# NOTE: You may want to consider using STARTTLS (`dbms.security.ldap.use_starttls`) over LDAPS
# for secure connections, in which case the default port will be sufficient.
#dbms.security.ldap.host=localhost:389

# Use secure communication with the LDAP server using opportunistic TLS.
# First an initial insecure connection will be made with the LDAP server, and then a STARTTLS command
# will be issued to negotiate an upgrade of the connection to TLS before initiating authentication.
#dbms.security.ldap.use_starttls=false

# The LDAP referral behavior when creating a connection. This is one of `follow`, `ignore` or `throw`.
# `follow` automatically follows any referrals
# `ignore` ignores any referrals
# `throw` throws an exception, which will lead to authentication failure
#dbms.security.ldap.referral=follow

#----------------------------------
# LDAP Authentication Configuration
#----------------------------------

# LDAP authentication mechanism. This is one of `simple` or a SASL mechanism supported by JNDI,
# e.g. `DIGEST-MD5`. `simple` is basic username
# and password authentication and SASL is used for more advanced mechanisms. See RFC 2251 LDAPv3
# documentation for more details.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.mechanism=simple

# LDAP user DN template. An LDAP object is referenced by its distinguished name (DN), and a user DN is
# an LDAP fully-qualified unique user identifier. This setting is used to generate an LDAP DN that
# conforms with the LDAP directory's schema from the user principal that is submitted with the
# authentication token when logging in.
# The special token {0} is a placeholder where the user principal will be substituted into the DN string.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

# Determines if the result of authentication via the LDAP server should be cached or not.
# Caching is used to limit the number of LDAP requests that have to be made over the network
# for users that have already been authenticated successfully. A user can be authenticated against
# an existing cache entry (instead of via an LDAP server) as long as it is alive
# (see `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`).
# An important consequence of setting this to `true` than needs to be well understood, is that
# Neo4j then needs to cache a hashed version of the credentials in order to perform credentials
# matching. This hashing is done using a cryptographic hash function together with a random salt.
# Preferably a conscious decision should be made if this method is considered acceptable by
# the security standards of the organization in which this Neo4j instance is deployed.
#dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled=true

#----------------------------------
# LDAP Authorization Configuration
#----------------------------------
# Authorization is performed by searching the directory for the groups that
# the user is a member of, and then map those groups to Neo4j roles.

# Perform LDAP search for authorization info using a system account or the user's own account.
#
# If this is set to `false` (default), the search for group membership will be performed
# directly after authentication using the ldap context bound with the user's own account.
# The mapped roles will be cached for the duration of `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`,
# and then expire, requiring re-authentication. To avoid frequently having to re-authenticate
# sessions you may want to set a relatively long auth cache expiration time together with this option.
# NOTE: This option will only work if the users are permitted to search for the
# group membership attributes on themselves in the directory.
#
# If this is set to `true`, the search will be performed using a special system account user
# with read access to all the users in the directory.
# You need to specify the username and password with the next two settings below with his option.
# Note that this account only needs read-only access to the relevant parts of the LDAP directory
# and does not need to have access rights to Neo4j or any other systems.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account=false

# An LDAP system account username to use for authorization searches when
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account` is `true`.
# Note that the `dbms.security.ldap.user_dn_template` will not be applied to this username,
# so you may have to specify a full DN.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username=

# An LDAP system account password to use for authorization searches when
# `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account` is `true`.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password=

# The name of the base object or named context to search for user objects when LDAP authorization is enabled.
# A common case is that this matches the last part of `dbms.security.ldap.user_dn_template`.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

# The LDAP search filter to search for a user principal when LDAP authorization is
# enabled. The filter should contain the placeholder token {0} which will be substituted for the
# user principal.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))

# A list of attribute names on a user object that contains groups to be used for mapping to roles
# when LDAP authorization is enabled.
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf

# An authorization mapping from LDAP group names to Neo4j role names.
# The map should be formatted as a semicolon separated list of key-value pairs, where the
# key is the LDAP group name and the value is a comma separated list of corresponding role names.
# E.g. group1=role1;group2=role2;group3=role3,role4,role5
#dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping=

# You could also use whitespaces and quotes around group names to make this mapping more readable,
# e.g: dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping=\
#          "cn=Neo4j Read Only,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"      = reader;    \
