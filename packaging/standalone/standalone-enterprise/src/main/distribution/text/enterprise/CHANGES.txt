1.7.M01 (2012-03-12)
--------------------
o Fixed bug in PropertyStore that during recovery would throw exception if the last record was incomplete.
o Fixes to transaction log start position caching which mitigates a performance issue and fixes a caching issue during rotation.
o Fixed a couple of issue around copying incomplete transaction to new log during a log rotation.
o Fixed a property cache poisoning bug and some stale references leaking.
o Fixed a data race issue between threads removing the same property while the node is evicted from cache.
o Fixed an issue where a property record in the logical log was missing its owner.
o Log messages in messages.log are now printed in UTC time zone so that it's the same across servers.
o Fix for an issue where a full rebuild of an id generator (rebuild_idgenerators_fast=false) could result
  in exception when adding free ids.
o Fix for issue which would close an id generator as clean if a startup failed at the wrong time, which would make
  the id generator diverge from the store it held ids for and possible truncate that store file the next clean shutdown.
Indexing:
  o Added LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer and a clear test for it which shows how to configure a case-insensitive exact index.
Cypher:
  o Added literal collections and the IN predicate
  o Added HEAD, TAIL, LAST and FILTER
  o Added ! so that missing property can evaluate to false
  o BREAKING CHANGE: To check whether a property exists on a node, use the HAS(...) function
  o Arithmetic & string concatenation
  o An identifier can now be assigned all the nodes/rels in the graph - START a=node(*)
  o Predicates can be specified inside of a pattern relationship description
Server:

  o SecurityRule implementations can now use simple wildcards to allow whole sub paths of URIs to be covered by the rule.
  o Added an "order" parameter to index REST queries to control result ordering.
Shell:
  o dbinfo command now able to print simple values as well as arrays and compound values as JSON output.
  o A shell server which isn't remotely avaiable doesn't touch RMI, neither does a client which connects
    to a server within the same JVM. This makes for less RMI garbage when forgetting to call shutdown().
  o Fixes problem with eval command in that it couldn't execute a single-line command, which made it impossible
    to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside
UDC:
  o Added MAC address to pings.
High Availablity and Backup:
  o Added config option for ha.max_concurrent_transactions_on_master. There was already
    an equivalent for clients, so those two go hand in hand.
  o Failure to rotate logical log is treated as a kernel panic event (just as expected in this case).
  o While copying a store from the master the broker is shut down to cancel out any noisy events from it during copy.
  o Added Broker#restart and implemented in ZooKeeperBroker to handle ZK session expirations.
  o Made ZK session timeout configurable.
  o Removed a retry/wait which held a monitor on HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase which could delay a master switch by 'read timeout' seconds.
  o Restructuring to use DI, configuration interfaces, less setters/getters, removed unecessary lifecycle classes,
    added proper life cycle support for services and lots and lots of other cleanups. This also removes the need for wrapping
    an entire HA graphdb in a wrapper to have the entities survive an internal restart.
  o Now full and incremental backup fetches and writes to disk the latest transaction if not present,
    allowing for an HA cluster to bootstrap itself.

1.6 (2012-01-19)
----------------
o New HA request type allows for copy of transaction interval from master to slave, to recover from missing logical log files.
o It is no longer required to run an update puller to trigger a master election when the master goes down abruptly.
o Multiple retries on store copy operations during startup, so that long copies that get interrupted have a chance to complete.
o Backup rotates messages.log with the timestamp of the backup operation
o New HA request type allows for copy of transaction interval from master to slave, to recover from missing logical log files.

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)
--------------------
o Corrected ZK Expired event handling. Now, instead of restarting the zookeeper client, the whole broker is restarted and newMaster is called.
  This leads to proper reconnect to the ZK quorum and parsing of the possibly updated cluster state.
o Added support for having one ZK cluster managing many HA clusters (controlled by ha.cluster_name config).
o Fixed issues with update puller being shutdown incorrectly and sometimes having references to stale objects.
o Added support for creating unique entities via Index#putIfAbsent.

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o [cypher] BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the syntax for iterable predicated ALL/NONE/ANY/SINGLE to use WHERE instead of a colon
o [cypher] BREAKING CHANGE: ExecutionResult is now a read-once, forward only iterator.
o [server] DEPRECATION: Cypher execution is now part of the core REST API, the cypher plugin is deprecated.
o [com] Now closes connections if either side dies during streaming
o [ha] Added entry about HAProxy in manual.
o [ha] Fixed an issue where pulling updates would fail if no master had been elected. Now it tries to find a new master instead.
o [ha] Exposes information about branched (and stashed) stores through JMX. 
o [server] Webadmin data browser now supports cypher queries
o [server] Updated to gremlin 1.4
o [server] Fixed bug in how auto indexes are represented
o [server] Max request execution time can now be limited
o [server] Hypermedia URLs returned by the server now set their host based on the HTTP host header
o [kernel] Lower memory usage of ImpermanentGraphDatabase.
o [kernel] Abstracted stores that stores id/name pairs into AbstractNameStore/AbstractNameRecord and removed lots of duplicated code.
o [kernel] Fixed a race condition in the property cache which cuold poison the cache.
o [kernel] Fixed an issue where a JVM crash in the wrong place would make the next startup rename the current logical log without
  incrementing the logVersion, making the next log rename fail.
o [kernel] Start records in the logical log aren't written until the transaction starts preparing/committing. This fixes an issue
  with the logical log not being rotated sometimes.
o [kernel] Added AbstractGraphDatabase#tx() which returns a TransactionBuilder possible of configuring the transaction to be "unforced"
  meaning that logical logs won't be forced when committing. Means better performance for small non-critical transactions.
o [kernel] Reduced number of proxy object instantiation and node record loading in general.
o [kernel] Added a wrapping graphdb abstraction, which makes instances survive even if the underlying db restarts.
o [cypher] Added allShortestPaths
o [cypher] Added COALESCE
o [cypher] Added column aliasing with AS
o [cypher] Fixed problems with optional graph elements

o A weak reference cache is now available for high load low latency workloads.
o The old index API has been deprecated (but still included and have been updated to use Lucene version 3.0.1).
o There is a new index API based on Lucene supporting multiple indexes both for nodes and relationships.
o Path algos can now be performed using the shell.

o All known bugs have been fixed. For more details see the individual milestone releases below.

1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
--------------------

- Kernel
o Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
  PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
o Added logging of recovery completion.
o Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
  the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
  lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

- Shell
o Fixed a problem where ShellServerExtension assumed the shell was enabled during shutdown, which could result in NPE.

- Lucene-index
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).
o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.
o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.

- HA
o When a new master is chosen, slaves throws away the id allocations they got from the previous master. This fixes a problem where occupied ids where reused.
o Enabled (and fixed problem with) thread on master which checks for dead slave connections and rolls back those transactions, so that their locks are released.
  This fixes a problem where an HA cluster would seem to freeze up and become unresponsive to write requests.
o Adding Log4j and Netty license information.
o Also closes the executor containing the connections.
o Changed dependency scopes.
o Shuts down databases after verifying them.

- Server
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now
o fixed duplicate paths for delete node or relationship from index
o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
o Added the ability extend the REST API with server plugins.
o Added back links to the first page in the HTML format.
o updating to Gremlin 0.6
o Updated the component site documentation with the new index API.
