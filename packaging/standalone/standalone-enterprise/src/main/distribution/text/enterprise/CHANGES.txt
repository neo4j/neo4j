2.2.4
-----
Cypher:
o DbHits for property lookups reduced to one per lookup
o Identifiers are properly exposed in nested foreach clauses
o Better eviction policy for the plan cache
o Fixes #4673 - index seeks experience nulls from IN

Kernel:
o Fixes #4910 - TransactionData incorrect when modifying/deleting relationships.
o Read only transactions no longer trigger Transaction events
o Log rotation will now always leave at least one logical log in place regardless of prune strategy
  decisions. This ensures that there are always transactions to serve to slave and incremental backups
o Lifted the 63 name constraint per transaction for index commands. It is now possible to update more than 63 legacy
  indexes and/or 63 property names in a single transaction.
o Fixed a ClassCastException error that manifested under very specific conditions when updating a legacy index.
o Batch importer will now check all constraints when it shuts down and will report any violations

Lucene Index:
o Fixed an index recovery issue where an imbalanced amount of write lock acquires compared to releases would make
  future index updates block indefinitely

Import tool:
o Empty files are now handled gracefully and no longer infinitely loop
o Multiline fields are now enabled by default

2.2.3
-----
Browser:
o Displays security policies from the database server
o Optionally disconnect from server after period of mouse and keyboard inactivity

Consistency checker:
o Fixes an issue where not all relationship references where consistency checked.
o Added additional consistency check for labels verifying that label ids stored in
  node records are sorted.

Csv:
o Detects and uses BOM (byte-order mark) headers in text files

Cypher:
o Returns nice error message when using aggregation inside
  of expressions that loop over collections
o Fixes #4758 - OPTIONAL MATCH when either side is null
o Fixes problem with projection of named paths
o Identifiers in scope of ORDER BY are no longer lost in rewriting

Graph algo:
o ShortestPath no longer has the option to find only paths of the supplied exact depth,
  this for keeping algorithm less complex and focusing on the most common use case.
  Finding paths of an exact depth is still provided from GraphAlgoFactory, currently
  backed by ExactDepthPathFinder.

HA:
o Transactions executed on slaves will now properly invalidate the master's cache on commit

Import tool:
o Prints summary in the end of how many entities where imported.

Kernel:
o Fixes an issue where a shutdown of a database that had a panic might mark the database as cleanly shut down
  where it actually needed a recovery on next startup.
o Setting for specifying query logging `dbms.querylog.filename` now specifies a file, not a directory.
  This setting also now has no default, which means query logging is now disabled by default.
o Transaction event handlers can now reach relationship start/end node and type in afterCommit
  for created and deleted relationships without requiring a transaction.

Lucene index:
o Fixes legacy index tx state issue where deleted entities might be visible when querying,
  where query included start/end node.
o Fixes issue where a transaction changing more than 63 legacy indexes would succeed, but might
  result in some updates written to wrong indexes. Now such transactions fail early with clear error.

Server:
o Improve force shutdown when stopping an unresponsive Neo4j server
o Updated jersey-servlet dependency to version 1.19
o Server configuration is now visible via JMX and in extension via the REST API

2.2.2
-----
General:

o Fixes problem when ordering on an aggregation function
o Fixes planning around indexes in COST planner
o Fixes planning of disconnected shortestpath in RULE planner
o Fixes type of varlength identifier to be collection of relationships

Graph algo:
o ShortestPath optimization where the traversal can abort earlier than before if detecting that
  one side is exhausted and the two sides are disconnected.

Import tool:
o Ability to skip duplicate nodes (nodes w/ duplicate input ids within the same id space).
  For this --skip-duplication-nodes as well as --skip-bad-relationships have been added.
  Number of bad entries to tolerate collectively is still controlled using --bad-tolerance
o Improved user feedback on common and import errors and user mistakes like forgetting to
  specify input files or leaving out mandatory header information etc. In some cases also
  points out a place in the manual for further information about a particular problem.
o Removes the --bad option which previously could specify the location and file name of
  the log containing bad input entries after an import. Now that log file will always be
  <into>/bad.log
o Input file names can now contain regular expressions and therefore match multiple files.
  Matching files will be correctly ordered according to any and all numbers found in their file names.

Kernel:
o Parallelized relationship import stage in the batch importer for better scalability
o Much better memory usage of :ID batch importer index, specifically around conflict resolutions.
o Properly propagates exceptions during startup of a database, regardless of whether or not shutdown throws exception.
o Much faster recovery after a non-clean shutdown or crash, due to transactions getting applied in batches.
o Fixes batch import issue with anonymous nodes, i.e. imported nodes w/o :ID. They could previously
  cause random failures during preparation of the IdMapper index.
o Reduced contention of updates to label scan store by using batching of concurrent transactions,
  similar to batched writes to the transaction log.
o Label scan store is built in parallel by the batch importer, to avoid waiting for it to build the first startup.
o Fixes an IdMapper encoding issue when using INTEGER id type which resulted in many unnecessary index conflicts,
  which in turn resulted in an unnecessarily high IdMapper memory consumption.

Desktop:
o Fixes issue with starting/stopping databases multiple times, where seemingly
  log lines where logged as many times as the database had been restarted.

Lucene index:
o Reduces memory usage during querying for legacy lucene indexes. Previously there would be a set
  potentially containing all ids returned in the query, now it will only contain ids from transaction state.
o Faster recovery of legacy lucene indexes, due to batching of transactions.

Cluster:
o Network exceptions that gets logged are now throttled, i.e. logged every N seconds at most,
  instead of for every occurence. This to remove fix an issue where a tight loop could fill up a log very fast.

HA:
o Fixes an issue in the high-performance cache, HPC, where the array would be much bigger than intended
  in JVMs with very large heap. This would result in failure to start the database.
o Aborts attempt to join cluster on recognizing foreign store, instead of forever trying and failing.

o Importer doesn't set any empty array properties during import
o Fixed issue where importer could assign wrong sets of properties on relationships
  in the vicinity of "bad" relationships
o Fixed issue with AIOOBE during property encoding in importer

  that would violate the constraint, to be committed.
o Added ability to scan index in addition to scanning node store
o Fixed issue where importer IdMapper collision detection would use excessive memory
o Performance improvements to importer, specifically around preparing IdMapper  

Server:
o Fixed issue with 4xx HTTP response codes not including proper ClientError status
o HTTP responses containing errors in the form of server stack traces now do so
  using the key 'stackTrace' as opposed to 'stacktrace'

  be upgraded
o Instances will now check, as part of the cluster join process, if another
  instance has a store of the same version but upgraded from a store copy
  that had different transaction count, preventing the possibility of
  binary incompatible stores participating in the same cluster
o Starting a HA cluster on an upgraded store will now work as expected, due
  to logs being upgraded as part of the store upgrade process

Backup:
o Command line tool no longer expects "-from" argument, but "-host" and "-port" instead

    those related to the traversal frameworks, are now deprecated and due to be moved
    into internal packages. This includes well-known classes such as EmbeddedGraphDatabase
    and HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase, both of which are replaced by GraphDatabaseFactory
    and HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory, respectively.
  o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated settings from org.neo4j.graphdb.factory.GraphDatabaseSettings. These settings are
    no longer effective and can be removed without any effect.
  o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated org.neo4j.graphdb.index.IndexProvider (and associated
    org.neo4j.graphdb.index.IndexIterable and org.neo4j.graphdb.index.IndexProviderKernelExtensionFactory). This has been
    replaced by the kernel extension mechanism.
  o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer#getPropertyValues(). Instead use
    org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer#getPropertyKeys() and org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer#getProperty(String).
  o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated methods from org.neo4j.kernel.GraphDatabaseAPI: #getDiagnosticsManager(),
    #getMessageLog(), #getIdGeneratorFactory(), #getKernelData() and #getPersistenceSource(). These are internal
    components which Kernel clients should not need to access. The entire org.neo4j.kernel.GraphDatabaseAPI interface is
    deprecated and will be removed in future.

    use org.neo4j.server.WrappingNeoServer.
  o BREAKING CHANGE: org.neo4j.server.database.Database is now an interface. Direct uses of the class can be replaced by
    one of its implementations.
  o Transactional endpoint status codes are now textual rather than numeric. Since the transactional endpoint was introduced
    in the 2.0.0 series, it is not considered a breaking change. It will, however, require modifying client code that depends

   A chunk size of at most 16M is still possible to configure.
 o Made read timeout for the "copy store" request twice that of the normal
   read timout to be more resilient to slow network or bogged down master

Kernel:
 o Removed contention around allocating and moving persistence windows so that a thread won't need to await
   another thread doing this refresh, instead just continue knowing that the windows will be optimally
   placed in a very near future.
 o Removed contention around translating a key (as String) into the ID by using copy-on-write map instead
   of a concurrent hash map. Used in property key as well as relationship type translation.

 o Changed precedence of database configuration over internal udc configuration
 o Added distribution information (dpkg, rpm, unknown)

1.8.M06 (2012-07-06)
--------------------
HA:

   optimistically push each transaction before tx.finish completes to reduce risk of branched data.
 o Added the ability for rolling upgrades from versions 1.5.3 onwards.
 o Changed the way master election notification and data gathering works, leading to massively reduced writing of data to
   the zookeeper service and a subsequent performance increase.

Kernel:
 o Configurable amount of logical logs to keep, by for example number of days or size on disk.
   keep_logical_logs configuration is extended to support values such as: "10 days", "200M size" a.s.o.
   Regardless of configuration there will always be at least the latest non-empty logical log left.
 o Reduced synchronization while memory mapping files, leading to increased multithreaded performance

Server:
 o Added support for multi line Cypher queries in webadmin browser

Lucene-index:
o Removed lucene_writers_cache_size and have lucene_searcher_cache_size decide for both, since
  it's doesn't make sense to have a writer w/o a searcher and isn't possible to have a searcher
  w/o its writer.
o Loosened contention regarding getting index searchers for querying.

Cypher:
 o CREATE and RELATE can now introduce path identifiers
 o String literals can now contain escape characters

 o Fixes around optional paths

1.8.M04 (2012-06-07)
--------------------
Kernel:
 o Additions to the traversal framework:
   + Bidirectional traversals (with BidirectionalTraversalDescription). AllPaths/AllSimplePaths
     uses this feature and are now faster due to less relationships being traversed.
   + Multiple start nodes (as well as multiple end nodes for bidirectional traversals).
   + PathExpander (RelationshipExpander for Paths) which has the full Path passed in instead of
     just the end node of the path. It can also see and modify a user defined traversal branch state.
   + Metadata about the traversal, for the time being: number of relationships traversal and
     number paths returned.
   + Added Path#reverseNodes() and Path#reverseRelationships which gives all nodes/relationships in
    a path in reverse order (starting from the end node going back to the start node). More relevant
  	in many scenarios as well as allowing for a more efficient implementation.
   + Sorting of traversal results, specify with TraversalDescription#sort(Comparable).
   + Some measure to reduce memory consumption and garbage generation during traversals.

Graph-algo:
 o AllPaths/AllSimplePaths uses the new bidirectional traversal feature in the traversal framework.
  Less relationships now needs to be traversed to find the requested paths.
 o Added an implementation of the shortest path algorithm with the bidirectional traversal feature.

--------------------
Kernel:
 o Changed array map to CHM in property index manager, better multithreaded performance
Shell:

 o Sessions now live on the server side instead of on the client, which means that not just
  serializable values can be set there. Paves the way for Cypher making use of it.
Server:
 o keep_logical_logs is now respected if set to false - default is still true
Cypher:
 o Added RELATE
 o Changed the CREATE syntax, so it looks more like RELATE
 o Fixes #506: delete head(rels) doesn't work

--------------------
o Fixed bug in PropertyStore that during recovery would throw exception if the last record was incomplete.
o Fixes to transaction log start position caching which mitigates a performance issue and fixes a caching issue during rotation.
o Fixed a couple of issue around copying incomplete transaction to new log during a log rotation.
o Fixed a property cache poisoning bug and some stale references leaking.
o Fixed a data race issue between threads removing the same property while the node is evicted from cache.
o Fixed an issue where a property record in the logical log was missing its owner.
o Log messages in messages.log are now printed in UTC time zone so that it's the same across servers.
o Fix for an issue where a full rebuild of an id generator (rebuild_idgenerators_fast=false) could result
  in exception when adding free ids.
o Fix for issue which would close an id generator as clean if a startup failed at the wrong time, which would make
  the id generator diverge from the store it held ids for and possible truncate that store file the next clean shutdown.
Indexing:
  o Added LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer and a clear test for it which shows how to configure a case-insensitive exact index.
Cypher:
  o Added literal collections and the IN predicate
  o Added HEAD, TAIL, LAST and FILTER
  o Added ! so that missing property can evaluate to false
  o BREAKING CHANGE: To check whether a property exists on a node, use the HAS(...) function

Server:
  o Fixed a NPE in guarded database for the result of Index#putIfAbsent.
  o Added SSL support in the server.
  o SecurityRule implementations can now use simple wildcards to allow whole sub paths of URIs to be covered by the rule.
  o Added an "order" parameter to index REST queries to control result ordering.
Shell:
  o dbinfo command now able to print simple values as well as arrays and compound values as JSON output.
  o A shell server which isn't remotely avaiable doesn't touch RMI, neither does a client which connects
    to a server within the same JVM. This makes for less RMI garbage when forgetting to call shutdown().
  o Fixes problem with eval command in that it couldn't execute a single-line command, which made it impossible
    to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside
UDC:
  o Added MAC address to pings.
High Availablity and Backup:
  o Added config option for ha.max_concurrent_transactions_on_master. There was already
    an equivalent for clients, so those two go hand in hand.
  o Failure to rotate logical log is treated as a kernel panic event (just as expected in this case).
  o While copying a store from the master the broker is shut down to cancel out any noisy events from it during copy.
  o Added Broker#restart and implemented in ZooKeeperBroker to handle ZK session expirations.
  o Made ZK session timeout configurable.
  o Removed a retry/wait which held a monitor on HighlyAvailableGraphDatabase which could delay a master switch by 'read timeout' seconds.
  o Restructuring to use DI, configuration interfaces, less setters/getters, removed unecessary lifecycle classes,
    added proper life cycle support for services and lots and lots of other cleanups. This also removes the need for wrapping
    an entire HA graphdb in a wrapper to have the entities survive an internal restart.
  o Now full and incremental backup fetches and writes to disk the latest transaction if not present,
    allowing for an HA cluster to bootstrap itself.

1.6 (2012-01-19)
----------------
o New HA request type allows for copy of transaction interval from master to slave, to recover from missing logical log files.
o It is no longer required to run an update puller to trigger a master election when the master goes down abruptly.
o Multiple retries on store copy operations during startup, so that long copies that get interrupted have a chance to complete.
o Backup rotates messages.log with the timestamp of the backup operation
o New HA request type allows for copy of transaction interval from master to slave, to recover from missing logical log files.

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)
--------------------
o Corrected ZK Expired event handling. Now, instead of restarting the zookeeper client, the whole broker is restarted and newMaster is called.
  This leads to proper reconnect to the ZK quorum and parsing of the possibly updated cluster state.
o Added support for having one ZK cluster managing many HA clusters (controlled by ha.cluster_name config).
o Fixed issues with update puller being shutdown incorrectly and sometimes having references to stale objects.
o Added support for creating unique entities via Index#putIfAbsent.

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o [cypher] BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the syntax for iterable predicated ALL/NONE/ANY/SINGLE to use WHERE instead of a colon
o [cypher] BREAKING CHANGE: ExecutionResult is now a read-once, forward only iterator.
o [server] DEPRECATION: Cypher execution is now part of the core REST API, the cypher plugin is deprecated.
o [com] Now closes connections if either side dies during streaming
o [ha] Added entry about HAProxy in manual.

o [kernel] Abstracted stores that stores id/name pairs into AbstractNameStore/AbstractNameRecord and removed lots of duplicated code.
o [kernel] Fixed a race condition in the property cache which cuold poison the cache.
o [kernel] Fixed an issue where a JVM crash in the wrong place would make the next startup rename the current logical log without
  incrementing the logVersion, making the next log rename fail.
o [kernel] Start records in the logical log aren't written until the transaction starts preparing/committing. This fixes an issue
  with the logical log not being rotated sometimes.
o [kernel] Added AbstractGraphDatabase#tx() which returns a TransactionBuilder possible of configuring the transaction to be "unforced"
  meaning that logical logs won't be forced when committing. Means better performance for small non-critical transactions.
o [kernel] Reduced number of proxy object instantiation and node record loading in general.
o [kernel] Added a wrapping graphdb abstraction, which makes instances survive even if the underlying db restarts.
o [cypher] Added allShortestPaths
o [cypher] Added COALESCE
o [cypher] Added column aliasing with AS
o [cypher] Fixed problems with optional graph elements

o Removal of the properties service, replaced with a discovery service to allow third-party apps to bind to the server at runtime and discover what services are offered and where.
o Changed the configuration file format to make it simpler and less error prone (but it is *not*) backwards compatible with earlier versions.
o Separated out the server plugin API for easier development, making only the only development dependency for server a very thin layer and small jar.

1.3.M02 (2011-02-10)
--------------------

o Gremlin updated to 0.7 and trimmed down to bare bones dependencies.
o Webadmin minor improvements in Console, Data browser and monitoring.

o There is a new index API based on Lucene supporting multiple indexes both for nodes and relationships.
o Path algos can now be performed using the shell.

o All known bugs have been fixed. For more details see the individual milestone releases below.

1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
--------------------

- Kernel
o Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
  PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
o Added logging of recovery completion.
o Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
  the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
  lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

- Shell
o Fixed a problem where ShellServerExtension assumed the shell was enabled during shutdown, which could result in NPE.

- Lucene-index
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).
o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.
o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.

- HA
o When a new master is chosen, slaves throws away the id allocations they got from the previous master. This fixes a problem where occupied ids where reused.
o Enabled (and fixed problem with) thread on master which checks for dead slave connections and rolls back those transactions, so that their locks are released.
  This fixes a problem where an HA cluster would seem to freeze up and become unresponsive to write requests.
o Adding Log4j and Netty license information.
o Also closes the executor containing the connections.
o Changed dependency scopes.
o Shuts down databases after verifying them.

- Server
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property:
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now
o fixed duplicate paths for delete node or relationship from index
o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
o Added the ability extend the REST API with server plugins.
o Added back links to the first page in the HTML format.
o updating to Gremlin 0.6
o Updated the component site documentation with the new index API.
