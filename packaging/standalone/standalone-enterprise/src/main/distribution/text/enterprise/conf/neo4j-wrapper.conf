#********************************************************************

# Java Heap Size: by default the Java heap size is dynamically
# calculated based on available system resources.
# Uncomment these lines to set specific initial and maximum
# heap size in MB.
#wrapper.java.initmemory=512
#wrapper.java.maxmemory=512

# G1GC generally strikes a good balance between throughput and tail
# latency, without too much tuning.
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+UseG1GC

# Have common exceptions keep producing stack traces, so they can be
# debugged regardless of how often logs are rotated.
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow

# Reduce probability of objects getting the same identity hash code
# via a race, by computing them with thread-local PRNGs.
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:hashCode=5

# Make sure that `initmemory` is not only allocated, but committed to
# the process, before starting the database. This reduces memory
# fragmentation, increasing the effectiveness of transparent huge
# pages. It also reduces the possibility of seeing performance drop
# due to heap-growing GC events, where a decrease in available page
# cache leads to an increase in mean IO response time.
# Try reducing the heap memory, if this flag degrades performance.
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch

# Trust that non-static final fields are really final.
# This allows more optimisations and improves overall performance.
# NOTE: Only enable this if you don't have extensions or depencies that may use reflection or serialization to
# change the value of final fields!
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+TrustFinalNonStaticFields

# Disable explicit garbage collection, which is occasionally invoked by the JDK itself.
wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+DisableExplicitGC

# Uncomment the following lines to enable garbage collection logging
#wrapper.java.additional=-Xloggc:data/log/neo4j-gc.log
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+PrintGCDetails
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+PrintPromotionFailure
#wrapper.java.additional=-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution

# Remote JMX monitoring, uncomment and adjust the following lines as needed.
# Also make sure to update the jmx.access and jmx.password files with appropriate permission roles and passwords,
# the shipped configuration contains only a read only role called 'monitor' with password 'Neo4j'.
# For more details, see: http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html
# On Unix based systems the jmx.password file needs to be owned by the user that will run the server,
# and have permissions set to 0600.
# For details on setting these file permissions on Windows see:
#     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/security-windows.html
