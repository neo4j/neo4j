o Fix for an issue where a full rebuild of an id generator (rebuild_idgenerators_fast=false) could result
  in exception when adding free ids.
o Fix for issue which would close an id generator as clean if a startup failed at the wrong time, which would make
  the id generator diverge from the store it held ids for and possible truncate that store file the next clean shutdown.

    to a server within the same JVM. This makes for less RMI garbage when forgetting to call shutdown().
  o Fixes problem with eval command in that it couldn't execute a single-line command, which made it impossible
    to do ./shell -c 'eval ...' from outside

  incrementing the logVersion, making the next log rename fail.
o [kernel] Start records in the logical log aren't written until the transaction starts preparing/committing. This fixes an issue
  with the logical log not being rotated sometimes.
o [kernel] Added AbstractGraphDatabase#tx() which returns a TransactionBuilder possible of configuring the transaction to be "unforced"
  meaning that logical logs won't be forced when committing. Means better performance for small non-critical transactions.
o [kernel] Reduced number of proxy object instantiation and node record loading in general.
o [kernel] Added a wrapping graphdb abstraction, which makes instances survive even if the underlying db restarts.
o [kernel] Detached LogExtractor from XaLogicaLog so that it can be used without having a db running.

o [cypher] Fixed problems with optional graph elements


1.6.M01 (2011-11-24)
--------------------
o ImpermantentGraphDatabase now uses purely in-memory structures for speed during tests. It's done on a FileChannel level
  so that every other aspect of the database is intact, just that the bytes end up in ByteBuffers instead of files.
o Fixed an issue with evaluators not executing correctly for the start node of a traversal.
o Fixed an issue with BufferOverflowException thrown sometimes during extraction of prepared transactions.
o Added graph properties, i.e. properties that belongs to the graph itself as opposed to a specific node or relationship.
  Useful for extensions which would like to store configuration and what not.
o Better multi-line support in shell, as well as case insensitive app names.
o GraphDatabaseService#getAllNodes and #getRelationshipTypes @Deprecated and moved to GlobalGraphOperations class,
  where also #getAllRelationships is implemented.
o Added LRU cache for open indexes so that a limit can be set. Thanks vivekprahlad (github id) for the patch.
o When using ImpermanentGraphDatabase RAMDirectory is used instead of FSDirectory. Useful for speed during testing.

o A weak reference cache is now available for high load low latency workloads.
o The old index API has been deprecated (but still included and have been updated to use Lucene version 3.0.1).
o There is a new index API based on Lucene supporting multiple indexes both for nodes and relationships.
o Path algos can now be performed using the shell.

o All known bugs have been fixed. For more details see the individual milestone releases below.

1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
--------------------

- Kernel
o Fixed an issues with PruneEvaluators getting invoked with the start node as argument.
  PruneEvaluators was never invoked with the start node before the arrival of Evaluator interface.
o Added logging of recovery completion.
o Added TransactionData#isDeleted(Node) and #isDeleted(Relationship) and also made
  the collection to hold these a HashSet instead of ArrayList. This allows fast
  lookups for asking if a node/relationship is deleted in a transaction.
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

- Shell
o Fixed a problem where ShellServerExtension assumed the shell was enabled during shutdown, which could result in NPE.

- Lucene-index
o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).
o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.
o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.

- HA
o When a new master is chosen, slaves throws away the id allocations they got from the previous master. This fixes a problem where occupied ids where reused.
o Enabled (and fixed problem with) thread on master which checks for dead slave connections and rolls back those transactions, so that their locks are released.
  This fixes a problem where an HA cluster would seem to freeze up and become unresponsive to write requests.
o Adding Log4j and Netty license information.
o Also closes the executor containing the connections.
o Changed dependency scopes.
o Shuts down databases after verifying them.

- Server
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.
o Webadmin: Moved charts into tabbed box, minor UI updates.
o Fixed an issue with initialization order of things in the server to make sure that RRD is initialized when it is needed.
o Webadmin: Added proper tab-like styling to chart tabs and scale selectors.
o Fixed bug in RRD memory usage sampler, making rounding happen at end of calculations, instead of in the midst of.
o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.
o Webadmin: Added kernel version to dashboard, fixed bug in chart drawing (was drawing when the charts are not visible under certain conditions).
o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now
o fixed duplicate paths for delete node or relationship from index
o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
o Added the ability extend the REST API with server plugins.
o Added back links to the first page in the HTML format.
o updating to Gremlin 0.6
o Updated the component site documentation with the new index API.
