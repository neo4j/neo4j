High Availability
=================

Neo4j High Availability or “Neo4j HA” provides the following two main features:

. Enable a _fault-tolerant database architecture_, where several Neo4j slave databases can be configured to be exact replicas of a single Neo4j master database.
  This allows the end-user system to be fully functional and both read and write to the database in the event of hardware failure.
. Enable a _horizontally scaling read-mostly architecture_ that enables the system to handle more read load than a single Neo4j database instance can handle.
