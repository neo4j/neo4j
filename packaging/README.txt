Neo4j Apoc 1.0 - Basic Neo4j examples

This is Apoc -- A Package Of Components for Neo4j. The purpose of this package
is to provide an easy-to-get-going distribution of the Neo4j graph database and a
handful of commonly used components. It includes the binary jar files for these
components as well as example code that shows basic usage.

Included in this release of Apoc is:

   neo4j-kernel:         the neo4j graph database engine
   neo4j-index:          indexing and data structures
   neo4j-remote-graphdb: thin layer to enable remote access to a neo4j instance
   neo4j-shell:          text command shell for browsing the graph
   neo4j-online-backup:  create backups of a running neo4j graph database
   neo4j-graph-algo:     graph algorithms (such as shortest path algorithm)
   
You can run the examples from the Unix and Windows start scripts in the bin/
directory. The shell-client script starts an neo4j-shell instance.

You'll find the source code to the examples in the examples/ directory.

The components are found in the lib/ directory, and the javadocs for the
Apoc components in the docs/ directory.
