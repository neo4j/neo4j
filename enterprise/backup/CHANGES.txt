2.2.0
-----
o Introduced 'gather-forensics' functionality which allows backup to fetch
  all transaction logs

2.2.0-M03
---------
o Fix an issue where a backup could not be used to seed a slave in HA
o Fix an issue where a backup could not be taken from a slave in HA, after master switch

2.2.0-M01
---------
o Backup tool exits with error if consistency check fails.

2.1.8
-----
o Add a "-gather-forensics" flag that will include the transaction log files in
  the backup.

2.1.7
-----
o Fixes bug where the backup process would result in stores
  inappropriate for use as slave instances in HA clusters,
  because of improper last txid information

2.1.6
-----
o Fixes an issue with backup, where it could happen that the backup
  would not be initialized with the proper last txid which could make
  the store inappropriate for use in HA

2.1.4
-----
o Command line tool no longer expects "-from" argument, but "-host" and "-port" instead

1.9.9
-----
o Backup script now exits with error if consistency check after full backup reveals errors

1.9.7/2.0.2
-----------
o Backup no longer differentiates between full and incremental backup, instead automatically chooses the best option
  to use. This also handles cases where a backup is very old and can no longer be incrementally backed up.
  OnlineBackup#incremental(..) and OnlineBackup.full(..) are now deprecated, and will be removed in the next major
  release (3.0.0).
o Fixes issue with backup client shutting down the network connection before
  the backup complete

2.0.1
-----
o HA backup instances now are logged as backup instead of "-1"

2.0.0-RC1
---------
o BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated org.neo4j.backup.check.ConsistencyCheck main class. This is replaced by
  org.neo4j.consistency.ConsistencyCheckTool.

1.9.4 (2013-09-19)
------------------
o Backup tool and command line utility now exit with status 1 in case the
  target store has mismatching store ID with the source.

1.9.RC2 (2013-04-30)
--------------------
o Reverts default backup port to 6362

1.9.RC1 (2013-04-15)
--------------------
o -full and -incremental backup flags are deprecated, type of backup is
  automatically determined by the contents of the target directory

1.9.M05 (2013-03-05)
--------------------
o Backup server now binds by default to 127.0.0.1

1.9.M04 (2013-01-17)
--------------------
o online_backup_port is now depracated in favour of online_backup_server, works with a port range
o online backup is now enabled by default if possible
o Improved error reporting for backup tool

1.9.M01 (2012-10-23)
--------------------
o Consistency check extracted into its own module (consistency-check).
o BackupTool extended to accept tuning parameters for consistency check.

1.7 (2012-04-18)
----------------
o Improvements to shell script messages and documentation

1.7.M01 (2012-03-12)
--------------------
o Added the ability to log diffs of all transactions seen by a VerifyingTransactionInterceptor.
o Now full and incremental backup fetches and writes to disk the latest transaction if not present,
  allowing for an HA cluster to bootstrap itself.

1.6 (2012-01-20)
---------------
o Backup rotates messages.log with the timestamp of the backup operation

1.6.M03 (2012-01-12)
--------------------
o Support for multiple HA clusters in one ZK cluster. Cluster selection is done with -ha.cluster_name.

1.6.M02 (2011-12-16)
--------------------
o Added progress indicator to backups
o More checks regarding properties in the incremental consistency checker.

1.5.M02 (2011-10-10)
--------------------
o Fixed a windows-specific issue for long-running backups in that the active logical log was locked by the backup. Solved by rotating before backup.

1.5.M01
-------

1.4
---

1.3 GA
------
o Removed dependency on HA. Now it is expected that resolving the master of a ZooKeeper cluster is the responsibility of the HA component, providing it as a @Service.
o Removed the -from-ha argument, since it is not needed
o Switched from explicit backup target implementation specification (ha or simple for the time being) to a URI format.

1.3.M03 (2011-02-25)
