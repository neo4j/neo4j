Backup
======

NOTE: The Backup features are only available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.

[[backup-introduction]]
== Introducing Backup ==

Backups are performed over the network, from a running Neo4j server and into a
local copy of the database store (the backup). The backup is run using the
+neo4j-backup+ tool, which is provided alongside Neo4j Enterprise.

[IMPORTANT]
Neo4j Server must be configured to run a backup service. This is enabled via
the configuration parameter `online_backup_enabled`, and is enabled by default.
The interface and port the backup service listens on is configured via the
parameter `online_backup_server` and defaults to the loopback interface and
port 6362. It is typical to reconfigure this to listen on an external
interface, by setting `online_backup_server=<my-host-ip-address>:6362`. It can
also be configured to listen on all interfaces by setting
`online_backup_server=0.0.0.0:6362`.

Performing a backup requires specifying the target host, an optional port, and
the backup location. The backup tool will automatically select a full or incremental backup, based on whether an existing backup is present at that location.

[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup: create a blank directory and run the backup tool
mkdir /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
./bin/neo4j-backup -host 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup: just specify the location of your previous backup
./bin/neo4j-backup -host 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup where the service is listening on a non-default port
./bin/neo4j-backup -host 192.168.1.34 -port 9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
----

=== Incremental Backups ===
An incremental backup is performed whenever an existing backup directory is specified. The backup tool will then copy any new transactions from the Neo4j server and apply them
to the backup. The result will be an updated backup that is consistent with the current
server state.

However, the incremental backup may fail for a number of reasons:

* If the existing directory doesn't contain a valid backup.
* If the existing directory contains a backup of a different database store.
* If the existing directory contains a backup from a previous database version.

[NOTE]
Note that when copying the outstanding transactions, the backup tool needs
access to the historical logical logs. These logical logs are kept by Neo4j and
automatically removed after a period of time, based on the
<<configuration-logical-logs,+keep_logical_logs+ configuration>>. If the
required logical logs have already been removed, the backup tool will do a full
backup instead.

[[backup-java]]
== Online Backup from Java ==

In order to programmatically backup your data full or subsequently incremental from a
JVM based program, you need to write Java code like

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-backup
source=org/neo4j/backup/TestBackup.java
tag=onlineBackup
classifier=test-sources

For more information, please see link:javadocs/org/neo4j/backup/OnlineBackup.html[the Javadocs for 
OnlineBackup]

[[backup-restoring]]
== Restoring Your Data ==

The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases.
To use a backup, all you need to do replace your database folder with the backup.
Just make sure the database isn't running while replacing the folder.
