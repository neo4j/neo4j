Backup
======

NOTE: The Backup features are only available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.

Backups are performed over the network live from a running graph database onto a local copy.
There are two types of backup: full and incremental.

A _full backup_ copies the database files without acquiring any locks, allowing for continued operations on the target instance. This of course means that
while copying, transactions will continue and the store will change. For this reason, the transaction that was running when the backup operation started
is noted and, when the copy operation completes, all transactions from the latter down to the one happening at the end of the copy are replayed on the backup
files. This ensures that the backed up data represent a consistent and up-to-date snapshot of the database storage.

In contrast, an _incremental backup_ does not copy store files -- instead it copies the logs of the transactions that have taken place since the last full or
incremental backup which are then replayed over an existing backup store. This makes incremental backups far more efficient than doing full backups every
time but they also require that a _full backup_ has taken place before they are executed.

Regardless of the mode a backup is created with, the resulting files represent a consistent database snapshot and they can be used to boot up a Neo4j instance.

The database to be backed up is specified using a URI with syntax

<running mode>://<host>[:port]{,<host>[:port]*}

Running mode must be defined and is either _single_ for non-HA or _ha_ for HA clusters. The <host>[:port] part
points to a host running the database, on port _port_ if not the default. The additional _host:port_ arguments
are useful for passing multiple coordinator instances.

[IMPORTANT]
Backups can only be performed on databases which have the configuration parameter `enable_online_backup=true` set.
That will make the backup service available on the default port (6362).
To enable the backup service on a different port use for example `enable_online_backup=port=9999` instead.

[[backup-embedded-and-server]]
== Embedded and Server ==

To perform a backup from a running embedded or server database run:
[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup
./neo4j-backup -full -from single://192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup where the service is registered on a custom port
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://192.168.1.34:9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
----

[[backup-java]]
== Online Backup from Java ==

In order to programmatically backup your data full or subsequently incremental from a 
JVM based program, you need to write Java code like

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-backup
source=org/neo4j/backup/TestBackup.java
tag=onlineBackup
classifier=test-sources
----

For more information, please see http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-enterprise/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/backup/OnlineBackup.html[the Javadocs for 
OnlineBackup]

[[backup-ha]]
== High Availability ==

To perform a backup on an HA cluster you specify one or more coordinators managing that cluster.

NOTE: If you have specified a cluster name for your HA cluster, you need to specify
      it when doing backups, so that the backup system knows which cluster to back up.
      Add the config parameter: `-cluster my_custom_cluster_name`

[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup from HA cluster, specifying two possible coordinators
./neo4j-backup -full -from ha://192.168.1.15:2181,192.168.1.16:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster, specifying only one coordinator
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from ha://192.168.1.15:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster with a specific name (specified by neo4j configuration 'ha.cluster_name')
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from ha://192.168.1.15:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup -cluster my-cluster

[[backup-restoring]]
== Restoring Your Data ==

The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases. To use a backup, all you need to do replace your database folder with the backup.
