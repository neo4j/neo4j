NAME
----
neo4j-backup - Neo4j Backup Tool

[[neo4j-backup-manpage]]
SYNOPSIS
--------

*neo4j-backup* -host <host> [-port <port>] -to target_directory

[[neo4j-backup-manpage-description]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------

A tool to perform live backups over the network from a running Neo4j graph database onto a local filesystem.
Backups can be either full or incremental.
The first backup must be a full backup, after that incremental backups can be performed.

The source(s) are given as host:port pairs, the target is a filesystem location.

BACKUP TYPE
-----------

*-full*::
  copies the entire database to a directory.

*-incremental*::
  copies the changes that have taken place since the last full or
incremental backup to an existing backup store.

The backup tool will automatically detect whether it needs to do a full or an incremental backup.

[[neo4j-backup-manpage-source-address]]
SOURCE ADDRESS
----------

Backup sources are given in the following format:

*-host <host> [-port <port>]*

*host*::
  In single mode, the host of a source database; in HA mode, the cluster address of a cluster member.

*port*::
  In single mode, the port of a source database backup service; in HA mode, the port of a cluster instance. If not given, the default value `6362` will be used for single mode, `5001` for HA.

[[neo4j-backup-manpage-usage-important]]
IMPORTANT
---------

Backups can only be performed on databases which have the configuration parameter *`enable_online_backup=true`* set.
That will make the backup service available on the default port (`6362`).
To enable the backup service on a different port use for example *`enable_online_backup=port=9999`* instead.

[[neo4j-backup-manpage-usage-windows]]
Usage - Windows
---------------

The *`Neo4jBackup.bat`* script is used in the same way.

EXAMPLES
--------

[source,shell]
----
# Performing a backup the first time: create a blank directory and run the backup tool
mkdir /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
neo4j-backup -host 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Subsequent backups using the same _target_-directory will be incremental and therefore quick
neo4j-backup -host freja -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing a backup where the service is registered on a custom port
neo4j-backup -host freja -port 9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing a backup from HA cluster, specifying a cluster member
./neo4j-backup -host oden -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing a backup from HA cluster, specifying a cluster member registered on custom port
./neo4j-backup -host oden -port 9191 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

RESTORE FROM BACKUP
-------------------

The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases.
To use a backup, replace your database directory with the backup.
