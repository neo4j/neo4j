 * In full backup we're more tolerant about missing transactions. Just as long as we fulfill this criterion:
 * We must be able to find and stream transactions that has happened since the start of the full backup.
 * Full backup will stream at most N transactions back, even if nothing happened during the backup.
 * Streaming these transaction aren't as important, since they are mostly a nice-to-have.
