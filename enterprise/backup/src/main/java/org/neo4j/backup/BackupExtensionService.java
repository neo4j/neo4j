/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a basic interface for backup sources to implement their
 * own resolution algorithms. The backup tool in general expects a location to
 * backup from but the format of it is in general specific to the source
 * database, while the OnlineBackup class expects a valid socket to connect to
 * and perform the backup. For that reason each implementation is expected to
 * provide a translator from its specific addressing scheme to a valid
 * <i>host:port</i> combination.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The prime consumer of this API is the HA component, where a set of cluster
 * members can be passed as targets to backup but only one will be used. It is
 * expected therefore that a {@link Service} implementation will be present on
 * the classpath that will properly communicate with the cluster and find the
 * master.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The URI is strictly expected to have a scheme component, matching the name of
 * the service implementation used to resolve it. The same holds for the default
 * case, with a scheme name of "single". The scheme specific fragment after that
 * will be the responsibility of the plugin to resolve to a valid host. In any
 * case, the resolve method is expected to return a valid URI, with a scheme
 * which is the same as the one passed to it (ie the service's name).
 * </p>
 * @deprecated This will move to an internal package in the future.
