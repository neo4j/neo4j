Server Plugins 
==============

.Quick info
***********
* The server's functionality can be extended by adding plugins. Plugins are user-specified code which
* extend the capabilities of the database, nodes, or relations. The neo4j server will then advertise
* the plugin functionality within representations as clients interact through  
***********

Plugins provide an easy way to extend the Neo4j REST API with new functionality, without the need to
invent your own API. Think of plugins as server-side scripts that can add functions for retrieving and
manipulating nodes, relationships, paths or properties.

[WARNING]
If you want to have full control over your API, and are willing to put in the effort, and understand
the risks, then Neo4j server also provides hooks for <<server-unmanaged-extensions,unmanaged extensions>>
based on JAX-RS.   

To create a plugin, your code must inherit from the ServerPlugin class, and ensure that it can produce 
an (Iterable of) Node, Relationship or Path, specify parameters, a point of extension and of course 
the application logic. An example of a plugin which augments the database (as opposed to nodes or
relations) follows:

[source,java]
----
@Description( "An extension to the Neo4j Server for getting all nodes or relationships" )
public class GetAll extends ServerPlugin
{
  @Name( "get_all_nodes" )
  @Description( "Get all nodes from the Neo4j graph database" )
  @PluginTarget( GraphDatabaseService.class )
  public Iterable<Node> getAllNodes( @Source GraphDatabaseService graphDb )
  {
      return graphDb.getAllNodes();
  }
 

@Description( "Get all relationships from the Neo4j graph database" )
  @PluginTarget( GraphDatabaseService.class )
  public Iterable<Relationship> getAllRelationships( @Source GraphDatabaseService graphDb )
  {
      return new NestingIterable<Relationship, Node>( graphDb.getAllNodes() )
      {
          @Override
          protected Iterator<Relationship> createNestedIterator( Node item )
          {
              return item.getRelationships( Direction.OUTGOING ).iterator();
          }
      };
  }
}
----

To deploy the code, simply compile it into a .jar file and place it onto the server classpath (which by
convention is $NEO4J_HOME/plugins). The .jar file must include the file 
META-INF/services/org.neo4j.server.plugins.ServerPlugin with the fully qualified name of the implementation
class. In this case, we'd have only a single entry in our config file, though multiple entries are allowed, 
each on a separate line:

[source,java]
----
org.neo4j.server.examples.GetAll
# Any other plugins in the same jar file must be listed here 
---- 

The code above makes an extension visible in the database representation (via the @PluginTarget annotation)
whenever it is served from the Neo4j Server. Simply changing the @PluginTarget parameter to Node.class or
Relationship.class allows us to target those parts of the datamodel should we wish. The functionality 
extensions provided by the plugin are automatically advertised in representations on the wire. For example,
clients can discover the extension implemented by the above plugin easily by examining the representations
they receive as responses from the server, e.g. by performing a GET on the default database URI:

 
[source, shell]
----
curl -v http://localhost:7474/db/data/
---- 

The response to the GET request will contain (by default) a JSON container that itself contains a container
called "extensions" where the available plugins are listed. In the following case, we only have the GetAll
plugin registered with the server, so only its extension functionality is available:

[source, javascript]
----
{
"extensions-info" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext",
"node" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node",
"node_index" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/index/node",
"relationship_index" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/index/relationship",
"reference_node" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/0",
"extensions_info" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext",
"extensions" : {
  "GetAll" : {
    "get_all_nodes" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/get_all_nodes",
    "get_all_relationships" : "http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/getAllRelationships"
  }
}
----
 
Performing a GET on one of the two extension URIs...

[source, shell]
----
curl http://localhost:7474/db/data/ext/GetAll/graphdb/get_all_nodes
----

... gives back the meta information about the service:

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "extends" : "graphdb",
  "description" : "Get all nodes from the Neo4j graph database",
  "name" : "get_all_nodes",
  "parameters" : [ ]
}
----

To use it, just POST to this URL, with parameters as specified in the description (though there are none in this case).

Through this model, any plugin can naturally fit into the general hypermedia scheme that Neo4j espouses - meaning that
clients can still take advantage of abstractions like  Nodes, Relationships and Paths with a straightforward upgrade
path as servers are enriched with plugins (old clients don't break).
