/**
 * This class carries the core raft membership change state machine, which defines the
 * legal state transitions when adding or removing members from the raft voting group.
 *
 * The state machine has these 4 states:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   INACTIVE                    completely inactive, not leader
 *
 *   IDLE,                       leader, but idle, no work to do
 *   CATCHUP IN PROGRESS,        member catching up
 *   CONSENSUS IN PROGRESS       caught up member being added to voting group
 * </pre>
 *
 * The normal progression when adding a member is:
 * <pre>
 *   IDLE->CATCHUP->CONSENSUS->IDLE
 * </pre>
 *
 * the normal progression when removing a member is:
 * <pre>
 *   IDLE->CONSENSUS->IDLE
 * </pre>
 *
 * Only a single member change is handled at a time.
