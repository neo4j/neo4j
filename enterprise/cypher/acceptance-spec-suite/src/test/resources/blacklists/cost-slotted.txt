Merge using unique constraint should update existing node
Merge using unique constraint should create missing node
Should match on merge using multiple unique indexes if only found single node for both indexes
Should match on merge using multiple unique indexes and labels if only found single node for both indexes
Should match on merge using multiple unique indexes using same key if only found single node for both indexes
Should create on merge using multiple unique indexes if found no nodes
Should create on merge using multiple unique indexes and labels if found no nodes
Should fail on merge using multiple unique indexes using same key if found different nodes
Should fail on merge using multiple unique indexes if found different nodes
Should fail on merge using multiple unique indexes if it found a node matching single property only
Should fail on merge using multiple unique indexes if it found a node matching single property only flipped order
Should fail on merge using multiple unique indexes and labels if found different nodes
Merge with uniqueness constraints must properly handle multiple labels
Works with property repeated in literal map in set
Works with property in map that gets set
Failing when creation would violate constraint
Explanation of in-query procedure call
Merging inside a FOREACH using a previously matched node
Merging inside a FOREACH using a previously matched node and a previously merged node
Merging inside a FOREACH using two previously merged nodes
Merging inside a FOREACH using two previously merged nodes that also depend on WITH
Inside nested FOREACH
Inside nested FOREACH, nodes inlined
Should handle running merge inside a foreach loop
Merge inside foreach should see variables introduced by update actions outside foreach

In-query call to procedure that takes no arguments
Calling the same procedure twice using the same outputs in each call
In-query call to VOID procedure that takes no arguments
In-query call to VOID procedure does not consume rows
In-query call to procedure with explicit arguments
In-query call to procedure with argument of type NUMBER accepts value of type INTEGER
In-query call to procedure with argument of type NUMBER accepts value of type FLOAT
In-query call to procedure with argument of type FLOAT accepts value of type INTEGER
In-query call to procedure with null argument
Filter should work
