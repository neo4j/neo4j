Feature: ExplainAcceptance

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Explanation of standalone procedure call
    And there exists a procedure test.labels() :: (label :: STRING?):
      | label |
      | 'A'   |
      | 'B'   |
      | 'C'   |
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN CALL test.labels()
    """
    Then the result should be:
      | label |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Explanation of in-query procedure call
    And there exists a procedure test.labels() :: (label :: STRING?):
      | label |
      | 'A'   |
      | 'B'   |
      | 'C'   |
    When executing query:
    """
    EXPLAIN
    CALL test.labels() YIELD label
    RETURN *
    """
    Then the result should be:
      | label |
    And no side effects
