Feature: OrderByAcceptance

  Scenario: ORDER BY nodes should return null results last in ascending order
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)-[:REL]->(:B),
             (:A)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[:REL]->(b:B)
      RETURN b
      ORDER BY b
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | b    |
      | (:B) |
      | null |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: ORDER BY relationships should return null results last in ascending order
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)-[:REL]->(:B),
             (:A)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r:REL]->()
      RETURN r
      ORDER BY r
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | r      |
      | [:REL] |
      | null   |
    And no side effects

  # The ORDER BY should work even if the "WITH x" will not become a `Projection` in the logical plan
  Scenario: ORDER BY with unwind primitive integer
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """

      UNWIND lst AS x
      WITH x
      ORDER BY x

    Then the result should be, in order:
      | x |
      | 1 |
      | 2 |
      | 3 |
      | 4 |

    And no side effects
