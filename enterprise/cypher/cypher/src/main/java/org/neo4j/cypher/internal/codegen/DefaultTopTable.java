/**
 * The default implementation of a Top N table used by the generated code
 *
 * It accepts tuples as boxed objects that implements Comparable
 *
 * Implements the following interface:
 * (since the code is generated it does not actually need to declare it with implements)
 *
 * public interface SortTable<T extends Comparable<?>>
 * {
 *     boolean add( T e );
 *
 *     void sort();
 *
 *     Iterator<T> iterator();
 * }
 *
 * Uses a max heap (Java's standard PriorityQueue) to collect a maximum of totalCount tuples in reverse order.
 * When sort() is called it collects them in reverse sorted order into an array.
 * The iterator() then traverses this array backwards.
