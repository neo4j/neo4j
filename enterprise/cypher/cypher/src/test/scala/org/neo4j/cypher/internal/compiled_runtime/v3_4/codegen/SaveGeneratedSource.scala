/**
  * This trait allows debugging generated queries, by generating queries through java source, then making sure that
  * the generated source is written to a place where Intellij can find it.
  *
  * How to use:
  * 1. Add this trait to the test class containing your test.
  * 2. Prefix your query with `CYPHER debug=generate_java_source`
  * 3. When running the test make sure that the Working Directory is set to
  *    the directory of the maven module containing your test.
  * 4. Mark `[your-maven-module]/target/generated-test-sources/cypher` as "Generated Sources Root".
  * 5. Make sure you have a breakpoint set to somewhere before execution enters the generated code,
  *    but after the code has been generated.
  * 6. When you run you test, as the first breakpoint triggers, find the directory
  *    `[your-maven-module]/target/generated-test-sources/cypher`, right click and select "Synchronize 'cypher'"
  *    If you have not done so before, this is a good time to "Mark Directory as" "Generated Sources Root".
  * 7. Now you should see the source file for the generated query, and be able to set breakpoints in that code,
  *    as well as stepping through it.
  * 8. Note that every time you re-run your test, you will have to repeat steps 5 to 7, since new code will be
  *    generated each time.
