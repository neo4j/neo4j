             * connection setup/teardown process. So, let's discuss what happens here more clearly.
             *
             * The sender and receiver are started. Trapped by the semaphore release on listeningAt()
             * The sender sends through the first message, it is received by the receiver. Trapped by the semaphore
             *      release on listeningAt() which is triggered on the first message receive on the receiver
             * The receiver is stopped, trapped by the overridden stop() method of the logging service.
             * The sender sends a message through, which will trigger the ChannelClosedException. This is where it
             *      gets tricky. See, normally, since we waited for the semaphore on NetworkReceiver.stop() and an
             *      happensBefore edge exists and all these good things, it should be certain that the Receiver is
             *      actually stopped and the message would fail to be sent. That would be too easy though. In reality,
             *      netty will not wait for all listening threads to stop before returning, so the receiver is not
             *      guaranteed to not be listening for incoming connections when stop() returns. This happens rarely,
             *      but the result is that the message "HelloWorld2" should fail with an exception (triggering the warn
             *      method on the logger) but it doesn't. So we can't block, but we must retry until we know the
             *      message failed to be sent and the exception happened, which is what this test is all about. We do
             *      that with a boolean that is tested upon continuously with sent messages until the error happens.
             *      Then we proceed with...
             * The receiver is started. Trapped by the listeningAt() callback.
             * The sender sends a message.
             * The receiver receives it, trapped by the dummy processor added to the receiver.
