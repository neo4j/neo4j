1.9 (2013-05-13)
----------------
o Coordinator doesn't ask itself for snapshots, solving a bug where starting an arbiter first would make the
  cluster unresponsive.

1.9.RC2 (2013-04-30)
--------------------
o Upgrades to Netty 3.6.3
o Elections don't start when a quorum is not available, fixing a certain class of race conditions when quorum is lost

  and immediately dies

1.9.RC1 (2013-04-15)
--------------------
o Removes URL discovery mechanism for clustering
o Moves from URI as an instance id to integers - they must be specified manually. The new setting is

o Instances can now be replaced if they have marked as fail if a new instance with the same id joins the cluster
o For a cluster to be formed now a majority of instances as configured in initial_hosts must be available
o Fixes around cluster formation from instances concurrently starting up
o Explicit join denial is now possible if an instance tries to join using a server_id already in use

1.9.M05 (2013-03-05)
--------------------
o Election happens for all roles when an instance comes online
o Snapshots are no longer received automatically on cluster join
o Instances starting concurrently will now discover each other instead of each starting
  their own cluster
o Acceptor store now does not grow unbounded and is garbage collected
o Learn requests are made towards and responded from all cluster members
o Cluster server will now by default bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
