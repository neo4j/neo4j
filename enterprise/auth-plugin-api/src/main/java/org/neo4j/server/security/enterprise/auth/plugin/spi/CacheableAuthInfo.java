/**
 * A cacheable object that can be returned as the result of successful authentication by an

 * <p>This object can be cached by the Neo4j authentication cache.
 *
 * <p>This result type is used if you want Neo4j to manage secure hashing and matching of cached credentials.
 * If you instead want to manage this yourself you need to use the separate interfaces
 * <tt>AuthenticationPlugin</tt> and <tt>AuthorizationPlugin</tt> together with
 * a <tt>CustomCacheableAuthenticationInfo</tt> result.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Caching of authentication info only occurs if it is explicitly enabled by the plugin, whereas
 * caching of authorization info (assigned roles) is enabled by default.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Caching of the authorization info (assigned roles) does not require the use of a <tt>CacheableAuthInfo</tt>
 * but will work fine with a regular <tt>AuthInfo</tt>.
