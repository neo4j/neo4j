/**
 * Keeps track of a set of channels and when they were last active.
 * Run this object periodically to close any channels that have been inactive for longer than the threshold.
 * This functionality is required because sometimes Netty doesn't tell us when channels are
 * closed or disconnected. Most of the time it does, but this acts as a safety
 * net for those we don't get notifications for. When the bug is fixed remove this class.
