/**
 * Receives and unpacks {@link Response responses}.
 * Transaction obligations are handled by {@link TransactionObligationFulfiller} and
 * {@link TransactionStream transaction streams} are {@link TransactionCommitProcess committed to the
 * store}, in batches.
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that any {@link TransactionStreamResponse response carrying transaction data} comes from the one
 * and same thread.
 * <p>
 * SAFE ZONE EXPLAINED
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM
 * A slave can read inconsistent or corrupted data (mixed state records) because of reuse of property ids.
 * This happens when a record that has been read gets reused and then read again or possibly reused in
 * middle of reading a property chain or dynamic record chain.
 * This is guarded for in single instance with the delaying of id reuse. This does not cover the Slave
 * case because the transactions that SET, REMOVE and REUSE the record are applied in batch and thus a
 * slave transaction can see states from all of the transactions that touches the reused record during its
 * lifetime.
 * <p>
 * SOLUTION
 * Master and Slave are configured with the same safeZone time.
 * Let S = safeZone time (more about safeZone time further down)
 * <p>
 * -> Master promise to hold all deleted ids in quarantine before reusing them, (S duration).
 * He thereby creates a safe zone of transactions that among themselves are guaranteed to be free of
 * id reuse contamination.
 * -> Slave promise to not let any transactions cross the safe zone boundary.
 * Meaning all transactions that falls out of the safe zone, as updates gets applied,
 * will need to be terminated, with a hint that they can simply be restarted
 * <p>
 * Safe zone is a time frame in Masters domain. All transactions that started and finished within this
 * time frame are guarantied to not have read any mixed state records.
 * <p>
 * Example of a transaction running on slave that starts reading a dynamic property, then a batch is pulled from master
 * that deletes the property and and reuses the record in the chain, making the transaction read inconsistent data.
 * <p>
 * TX starts reading
 * tx here
 * <pre>
 * v
 * |aaaa|->|aaaa|->|aaaa|->|aaaa|
 * 1       2       3       4
 * </pre>
 * "a" string is deleted and replaced with "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
 * <pre>
 * tx here
 * v
 * |bbbb|->|bbbb|->|bbbb|->|bbbb|
 * 1       2       3       4
 * </pre>
 * TX continues reading and does not know anything is wrong,
 * returning the inconsistent string "aaaaaaaabbbbbbbb".
 * <pre>
 * tx here
 * v
 * |bbbb|->|bbbb|->|bbbb|->|bbbb|
 * 1       2       3       4
 * </pre>
 * Example of how the safe zone window moves while appying a batch

 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * What we see in this diagram is a slave pulling updates from the master.
 * While doing so, the safe zone window |<---S--->| is pushed forward. NOTE that we do not see any explicit transaction
 * running on slave. Only the times (A, B, C, D) that we discuss.
 * <p>
 * slaveTx start on slave when slave is in SLAVE STATE 1
 * - Latest applied transaction on slave has timestamp A and safe zone is A-S.
 * - slaveTx.startTime = A
 * <p>
 * Scenario 1 - slaveTx finish when slave is in SLAVE STATE 2
 * Latest applied transaction in store has timestamp B and safe zone is B-S.
 * slaveTx did not cross the safe zone boundary as slaveTx.startTime = A > B-S
 * We can safely assume that slaveTx did not read any mixed state records.
 * <p>
 * Scenario 2 - slaveTx has not yet finished in SLAVE STATE 3
 * Latest applied transaction in store has timestamp C and safe zone is C-S.
 * We are just about to apply the next part of the batch and push the safe zone window forward.
 * This will make slaveTx.startTime = A < C-S. This means Tx is now in risk of reading mixed state records.
 * We will terminate slaveTx and let the user try again.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE ABOUT TX_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP</b>
 * commitTimestamp is used by {@link MetaDataStore} to keep track of the commit timestamp of the last committed
 * transaction. When starting up a db we can not always know what the the latest commit timestamp is but slave need it
 * to know when a transaction needs to be terminated during batch application.
 * The latest commit timestamp is an important part of "safeZone" that is explained in
 * TransactionCommittingResponseUnpacker.
 * <p>
 * Here are the different scenarios, what timestamp that is used and what it means for execution.
 * <p>
 * Empty store <br>
 * TIMESTAMP: {@link TransactionIdStore#BASE_TX_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP} <br>
 * ==> FINE. NO KILL because no previous state can have been observed anyway <br>
 * <p>
 * Upgraded store w/ tx logs <br>
 * TIMESTAMP CARRIED OVER FROM LOG <br>
 * ==> FINE <br>
 * <p>
 * Upgraded store w/o tx logs <br>
 * TIMESTAMP {@link TransactionIdStore#UNKNOWN_TX_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP} (1) <br>
 * ==> SLAVE TRANSACTIONS WILL TERMINATE WHEN FIRST PULL UPDATES HAPPENS <br>
 * <p>
 * Store on 2.3.prev, w/ tx logs (no upgrade) <br>
 * TIMESTAMP CARRIED OVER FROM LOG <br>
 * ==> FINE <br>
 * <p>
 * Store on 2.3.prev w/o tx logs (no upgrade) <br>
 * TIMESTAMP {@link TransactionIdStore#UNKNOWN_TX_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP} (1) <br>
 * ==> SLAVE TRANSACTIONS WILL TERMINATE WHEN FIRST PULL UPDATES HAPPENS <br>
 * <p>
 * Store already on 2.3.next, w/ or w/o tx logs <br>
 * TIMESTAMP CORRECT <br>
 * ==> FINE
