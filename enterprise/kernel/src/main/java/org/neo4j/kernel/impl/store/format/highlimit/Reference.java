/**
 * {@link #encode(long, PageCursor) Encoding} and {@link #decode(PageCursor) decoding} of {@code long}
 * references, max 58-bit, into an as compact format as possible. Format is close to how utf-8 does similar encoding.
 *
 * Basically one or more header bits are used to note the number of bytes required to represent a
 * particular {@code long} value followed by the value itself. Number of bytes used for any long ranges from
 * 3 up to the full 8 bytes. The header bits sits in the most significant bit(s) of the most significant byte,
 * so for that the bytes that make up a value is written (and of course read) in big-endian order.
 *
 * Negative values are also supported, in order to handle relative references.

        //
        // Before we start, I have one plea: Please don't extract the constants out of this function. It is easier to
        // make sense of them when they are embedded within the context of the code. Also, while some of the constants
        // have the same value, they might change for different reasons, so let's just keep them inlined.
        //
        // The code is easier to read when it's all together, so I'll keep the code and the comment separate, and make
        // the comment refer to the code with <N> marks.
        //
        // <1>
        // The first byte of a reference is the header byte. It is an unsigned byte where all the bits matter, but Java
        // has no such concept as an unsigned byte, so we instead store the byte in a 32-bit int, and mask it with 0xFF
        // to read it as if it was unsigned. The 0xFF mask makes sure that the highest-order bit, which would otherwise
        // be used as a sign-bit, stays together with the other 7 bits in the lowest-order byte of the int.
        //
        // <2>
        // The header determines how many bytes go into the reference. These are the size marks. If the first bit of
        // the header is zero, then we have zero size marks and the reference takes up 3 bytes. If the header starts
        // with the bits 10, then we have one size mark and the reference takes up 4 bytes. We can have up to 5 size
        // marks, where the last two options are 11110 for a 7 byte reference, and 11111 for an 8 byte reference.
        // We count the size marks as follows:
        //  1. First extract the 5 high-bits. 0xF8 is 11111000, so xxxx_xxxx & 0xF8 => xxxx_x000.
        //  2. The x'es are a number of ones, possibly zero, followed by a zero. There's an instruction to count
        //     leading zeros, but not leading ones, so we have to invert the 1 size marks into 0s, and the possible 0
        //     end mark into a 1. We use the `& 0xFF` trick to prevent the leading size mark from turning into a
        //     sign-bit. So (~xxxx_x000) & 0xFF => XXXX_X111, e.g. 0111_1000 (no size marks) becomes 1000_0111, and
        //     1101_1000 (two size marks) becomes 0010_0111.
        //  3. Now we can count the leading zeros to find the end mark. Remember that the end-mark is the zero-bit after
        //     the size marks. We *always* have this end-mark at this point, because any 1 in the highest-bit of the
        //     reference was masked to 0 in step 1 above.
        //  4. When we count the number of leading zeros, we have thus far been thinking about the header as a single
        //     byte. However, the register we have been working on is a 32-bit integer, so we have to subtract 3 times 8
        //     bits to get the number of size marks in the original header *byte*.
        //
        // <3>
        // The sign-bit is located after the end-mark, or after the last size mark in the case of an 8 byte reference.
        // We have 8 bits in the header byte, so if we want to place the sign-bit at the lowest-order bit location,
        // then we can think of the size marks and optional end-mark as a pre-shift, pushing the sign-bit towards the
        // low end. We just have to figure out how many bits are left to shift over.
        //
        // <4>
        // If the sign-bit is 1, then we want to produce the 64-bit signed integer number -1, which consists of 64
        // consecutive 1-bits. If the sign-bit is 0, then we want to produce 0, which in binary is 64 consecutive
        // 0-bits. The reason we do this is how negative numbers work. It turns out that -X == -1 ^ (X - 1). Since
        // our compression scheme is all about avoiding the storage of unnecessary high-order zeros, we can more easily
        // store the (X - 1) part plus a sign bit, than a long string of 1-bits followed by useful data. For example,
        // the negative number -42 is 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111010110 in binary,
        // while 41 is just 101001. And given our equation above, -1 ^ 41 == -42.
        //
        // <5>
        // After the size marks, the end-mark and the sign-bit comes a few bits of payload data. The sign-bit location
        // marks the end of the meta-data bits, so we use that as a base for computing a mask that will remove all the
        // meta-data bits. Since the smallest reference takes up 3 bytes, we can immediately shift those payload bits
        // up 16 places to make room for the next two bytes of payload.
        //
        // <6>
        // Then we read the next two bytes (with unsigned mask) and save for the sign-component manipulation, we now
        // have a complete 3-byte reference.
        //
        // <7>
        // The size marks determines how many more bytes the reference takes up, so we loop through them and shift the
        // register up 8 places every time, and add in the next byte with an unsigned mask.
        //
        // <8>
        // Finally XOR the register with the sign component and we have our final value.
