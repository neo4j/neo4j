High Availability setup tutorial
================================

This is a guide to set up a Neo4j HA cluster and run embedded Neo4j or Neo4j Server instances participating as cluster members.
This tutorial shows how to do this on a single computer. Adjust configuration accordingly if you are using several separate computers to run your clusters.

== Background ==

A Neo4j HA cluster consists of a set of Neo4j Enterprise instances, either running in embedded or server mode. All that
is needed to set this up is to configure the instances so that they can find each other and communicate over the network.

[TIP]
Neo4j Server (see <<server>>) and Neo4j Embedded (see <<configuration-introduction>>) can both be used as nodes in the same HA cluster.
This opens for scenarios where one application can insert and update data via a Java or JVM language based application, and other instances can run Neo4j Server and expose the data via the REST API (<<rest-api>>).

Below, you will see how to set up a cluster with 3 participating Neo4j instances.

=== Download and unpack Neo4j Enterprise ===

Download and unpack three installations of Neo4j Enterprise 
(called +$NEO4J_HOME1+, +$NEO4J_HOME2+, +$NEO4J_HOME3+) from http://neo4j.org/download[the Neo4j download site].

== Start the Neo4j Servers in HA mode ==

In your 'conf/neo4j.properties' file, enable HA by setting the necessary parameters for all 3 installations, adjusting the +ha.server_id+ for all instances.
Neo4j HA uses two ports, one for transmitting data and one for cluster coordination.
The cluster coordination port is by default set to a range, and Neo4j will try to bind in this range on startup, so there is no need to specify port number for that.
The config files should include the following:

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME1/conf/neo4j.properties
#unique server id for this graph database
#can not be negative id and must be unique
ha.server_id = 1

#ip and port for this instance to bind to
ha.server = localhost:6361

#list of instances in this cluster
ha.initial_hosts = localhost:5001,localhost:5002,localhost:5003
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME2/conf/neo4j.properties
#unique server id for this graph database
#can not be negative id and must be unique
ha.server_id = 2

#ip and port for this instance to bind to
ha.server = localhost:6362

#list of instances in this cluster
ha.initial_hosts = localhost:5001,localhost:5002,localhost:5003
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME3/conf/neo4j.properties
#unique server id for this graph database
#can not be negative id and must be unique
ha.server_id = 3

#ip and port for this instance to bind to
ha.server = localhost:6363

#list of instances in this cluster
ha.initial_hosts = localhost:5001,localhost:5002,localhost:5003
----

To avoid port clashes when starting the servers, adjust the ports for the REST endpoints in all instances under 'conf/neo4j-server.properties' and enable HA mode:

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME1/conf/neo4j-server.properties
...
# http port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7474
...
# https port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.https.port=7473
...
# Allowed values:
# HA - High Availability
# SINGLE - Single mode, default.
# To run in High Availability mode, configure the coord.cfg file, and the
# neo4j.properties config file, then uncomment this line:
org.neo4j.server.database.mode=HA
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME2/conf/neo4j-server.properties
...
# http port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7475
...
# https port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.https.port=7472
...
# Allowed values:
# HA - High Availability
# SINGLE - Single mode, default.
# To run in High Availability mode, configure the coord.cfg file, and the
# neo4j.properties config file, then uncomment this line:
org.neo4j.server.database.mode=HA
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME3/conf/neo4j-server.properties
...
# http port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7476
...
# https port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.https.port=7471
...
# Allowed values:
# HA - High Availability
# SINGLE - Single mode, default.
# To run in High Availability mode, configure the coord.cfg file, and the
# neo4j.properties config file, then uncomment this line:
org.neo4j.server.database.mode=HA
----


To avoid JMX port clashes adjust the assigned ports for all instances in 'conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf'.
The paths to the 'jmx.password' and 'jmx.access' files also needs to be set.
Note that the 'jmx.password' file needs the correct permissions set, see the configuration file for further information.

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME1/conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf
...
wrapper.java.additional.4=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3637
wrapper.java.additional.5=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=conf/jmx.password
wrapper.java.additional.6=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=conf/jmx.access
...
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME2/conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf
...
wrapper.java.additional.4=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3638
wrapper.java.additional.5=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=conf/jmx.password
wrapper.java.additional.6=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=conf/jmx.access
...
----

[source,properties]
----
#$NEO4J_HOME3/conf/neo4j-server.properties
...
wrapper.java.additional.4=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3639
wrapper.java.additional.5=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=conf/jmx.password
wrapper.java.additional.6=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=conf/jmx.access
...
----

Now, start all three server instances.

[source,shell]
----
neo4j_home1$ ./bin/neo4j start
neo4j_home2$ ./bin/neo4j start
neo4j_home3$ ./bin/neo4j start
----

Now, you should be able to access the 3 servers (the first one being elected as master since it was started first) at 
http://localhost:7474/webadmin/\#/info/org.neo4j/High%20Availability/,
http://localhost:7475/webadmin/\#/info/org.neo4j/High%20Availability/
and
http://localhost:7476/webadmin/#/info/org.neo4j/High%20Availability/
and check the status of the HA configuration.
Alternatively, the REST API is exposing JMX, so you can check the HA JMX bean with for example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '["org.neo4j:*"]' \
  http://localhost:7474/db/manage/server/jmx/query
----

Which will get a response along the lines of the following:

[source,javascript]
----
"description" : "Information about all instances in this cluster",
    "name" : "InstancesInCluster",
    "value" : [ {
      "description" : "org.neo4j.management.InstanceInfo",
      "value" : [ {
        "description" : "address",
        "name" : "address"
      }, {
        "description" : "instanceId",
        "name" : "instanceId"
      }, {
        "description" : "lastCommittedTransactionId",
        "name" : "lastCommittedTransactionId",
        "value" : 1
      }, {
        "description" : "serverId",
        "name" : "serverId",
        "value" : 1
      }, {
        "description" : "master",
        "name" : "master",
        "value" : true
      } ],
      "type" : "org.neo4j.management.InstanceInfo"
    }
----

== Start Neo4j Embedded in HA mode ==

If you are using Maven and Neo4j Embedded, simply add the following dependency to your project:

["source","xml","unnumbered","2",presubs="attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>neo4j-ha</artifactId>
   <version>{neo4j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you prefer to download the jar files manually, they are included in the http://neo4j.org/download/[Neo4j distribution].

The difference in code when using Neo4j-HA is the creation of the graph database service.

[source,java]
----
GraphDatabaseService db = new HighlyAvailableGraphDatabaseFactory().
                              newHighlyAvailableDatabaseBuilder( path ).
                              setConfig( config ).
                              newGraphDatabase();
----

The configuration can contain the standard configuration parameters (provided as part of the +config+ above or
in 'neo4j.properties' but will also have to contain:

[source,properties]
----
#HA instance1
#unique server id for this graph database
#can not be negative id and must be unique
ha.server_id = 1

#ip and port for this instance to bind to
ha.server = localhost:6361

#addresses and ports other cluster members use, to try and join the cluster through them
ha.initial_hosts = localhost:5001,localhost:5002,localhost:5003

remote_shell_enabled = true
----

First we start up one highly available database instance, pointing out a path and configuration, as shown above.

We created a config file with server id=1 and enabled the remote shell. It should now be possible to connect to the instance using <<shell>>:

[source,shell]
----
neo4j_home1$ ./bin/neo4j-shell -port 1337
NOTE: Remote Neo4j graph database service 'shell' at port 1337
Welcome to the Neo4j Shell! Enter 'help' for a list of commands

neo4j-sh (0)$ set name "Master says Hi"
neo4j-sh (Master says Hi,0)$
----

Since it is the first instance to join the cluster it is elected master.
Starting another instance would require a second configuration and another path to the db.

[source,properties]
----
#HA instance2
#unique server id for this graph database
#can not be negative id and must be unique
ha.server_id = 2

#ip and port for this instance to bind to
ha.server = localhost:6362§

#addresses and ports other cluster members use, to try and join the cluster through them
ha.initial_hosts = localhost:5001,localhost:5002,localhost:5003

remote_shell_enabled = true
remote_shell_port=1338
----

Now start the shell connecting to port 1338:

[source,shell]
----
neo4j_home1$ ./bin/neo4j-shell -port 1338
NOTE: Remote Neo4j graph database service 'shell' at port 1338
Welcome to the Neo4j Shell! Enter 'help' for a list of commands

neo4j-sh (Master says Hi,0)$ set name "Slave says Hi"
neo4j-sh (Slave says Hi,0)$
----

Quickly going over to the master's shell will yield

[source,shell]
----
neo4j-sh (Master says Hi,0)$ ls -p
*name=[Slave says Hi]
neo4j-sh (Slave says Hi,0)$
----

You can start sending requests to either master or slave members of the cluster, and they will be coordinated and replicated for you.
