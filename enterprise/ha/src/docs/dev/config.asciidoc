= HA Setup and configuration

Neo4j HA can be set up to accommodate differing requirements for load, fault tolerance and available hardware.

In HA mode, Neo4j instances form a cluster.
The instances monitor each others' availability to take account of instances joining and leaving the cluster.
They elect one instance to be the master, and designate the other instances to be slaves.

For installation instructions of a High Availability cluster see <<ha-setup-tutorial>>.

== Specifying cluster members ==

Specify the instances that should form the cluster by supplying `ha.initial_hosts`, a comma-separated list of URLs.
When each instance starts, if it can contact any of the initial hosts, then it will form a cluster with them,
otherwise it will start its own cluster.

Note that the parameter is called `ha.initial_hosts` because it's only used when instances initially join the cluster.
This means that you can extend the cluster without changing the configuration of existing instances.

== Server configuration ==

If you are running Neo4j server, specify `dbms.mode=HA` in <<file-locations, _neo4j.conf_>>.

See the <<configuration-settings,configuration reference section>> for detailed documentation on available configuration options.

== Database configuration ==

HA configuration parameters should be supplied alongside general Neo4j parameters in _neo4j.conf_.
There are many configurable parameters. In most cases it isn't necessary to modify the default values.
The only parameters that need to be specified are `ha.server_id` and `ha.initial_hosts`.

See the <<configuration-settings,configuration reference section>> for detailed documentation on available configuration options.
