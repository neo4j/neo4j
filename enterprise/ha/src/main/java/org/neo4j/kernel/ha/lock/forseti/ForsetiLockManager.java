/**
 * <h1>Forseti, the Nordic god of justice</h1>
 *
 * Forseti is a lock manager using the dreadlocks deadlock detection algorithm, which means
 * deadlock detection does not require complex RAG traversal and can be found in O(1).
 *
 * In the best case, Forseti acquires a lock in one CAS instruction, and scales linearly with the number of cores.
 * However, since it uses a shared-memory approach, it will most likely degrade in use cases where there is high
 * contention and a very large number of sockets running the database.
 *
 * As such, it is optimized for servers with up to, say, 16 cores across 2 sockets. Past that other strategies such
 * as centralized lock services using message passing may yield better results.
 *
 * <h2>Locking algorithm</h2>
 *
 * Forseti is used by acquiring clients, which act as agents on behalf of whoever wants to grab locks. The clients
 * have access to a central map of locks.
 *
 * To grab a lock, a client must insert itself into the holder list of the lock it wants. The lock may either be a
 * shared lock or an exclusive lock. In the case of a shared lock, the client simply appends itself to the holder list.
 * In the case of an exclusive lock, the client has it's own unique exclusive lock, which it must put into the lock map
 * using a CAS operation.
 *
 * Once the client is in the holder list, it has the lock.
 *
 * <h2>Deadlock detection</h2>
 *
 * Each Client maintains a waiting-for list, which by default always contains the client itself. This list indicates
 * which other clients are blocking our progress. By default, then, if client A is waiting for no-one, its waiting-for
 * list will contain only itself:
 *
 * A.waitlist = [A]
 *
 * Once the client is blocked by someone else, it will copy this someones entire wait list into it's own. Assuming A
 * becomes blocked by B, and B has a wait list of:
 *
 * B.waitlist = [B]
 *
 * Then A will modify is's wait list as:
 *
 * A.waitlist = [A] U [B] => [A,B]
 *
 * It will do this in a loop, continiously figuring out the union of wait lists for all clients it waits for. The magic
 * then happens whenever one of those clients become blocked on client A. Assuming client B now has to wait for A,
 * it will also perform a union of A's wait list (which is [A,B] at this point):
 *
 * B.waitlist = [B] U [A,B]
 *
 * As it performs this union, B will find itself in A's waiting list, and when it does, it has detected a deadlock.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Future work</h2>
 *
 * We have at least one type of lock (SchemaLock) that can be held concurrently by several hundred transactions. It may
 * be worth investigating fat locks, or in any case optimize the current way SharedLock adds and removes clients from
 * its holder list.
 *
 * The maps used by forseti should be replaced by faster concurrent maps, perhaps a striped hopscotch map or something
 * similar.
