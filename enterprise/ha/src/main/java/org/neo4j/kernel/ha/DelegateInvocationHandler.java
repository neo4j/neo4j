/**
 * InvocationHandler for dynamic proxies that delegate calls to a given backing implementation. This is mostly
 * used to present a single object to others, while being able to switch implementation at runtime.
 * 
 * There are concepts of {@link #snapshot(Object)} and {@link #cement(Object)} in here, which serves different purposes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #snapshot(Object)}: acquire the actual delegate at this particular point in time, pulling it out
 * from the proxy and using it directly. This is used for acquiring a snapshot and keep using that particular
 * instance, even if a new delegate is assigned for this handler.</li>
 * <li>{@link #cement(Object)}: acquire a proxy that will have its delegate assigned the next call to
 * {@link #setDelegate(Object)}. This is useful if one {@link DelegateInvocationHandler} depends on
 * another which will have its delegate set later than this one.</li>
