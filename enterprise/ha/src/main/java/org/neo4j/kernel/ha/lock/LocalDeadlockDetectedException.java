/**
 * Temporary exception to aid in driving out a nasty "lock get stuck" issue in HA. Since it's subclasses
 * {@link DeadlockDetectedException} it will be invisible to users and code that already handle such
 * deadlock exceptions and retry. This exception is thrown instead of awaiting a lock locally on a slave
 * after it was acquired on the master, since applying a lock locally after master granted it should succeed,
 * or fail; it cannot wait for another condition.
 *
 * While this work-around is in place there is more breathing room to figure out the real problem preventing
 * some local locks to be grabbed.
