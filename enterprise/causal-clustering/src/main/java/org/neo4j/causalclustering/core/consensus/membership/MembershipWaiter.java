/**
 * Waits until member has "fully joined" the raft membership.
 * We consider a member fully joined where:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is a member of the voting group
 * (its opinion will count towards leader elections and committing entries), and</li>
 * <li>It is sufficiently caught up with the leader,
 * so that long periods of unavailability are unlikely, should the leader fail.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To determine whether the member is sufficiently caught up, we check periodically how far behind we are,
 * once every {@code maxCatchupLag}. If the leader is always moving forwards we will never fully catch up,
 * so all we look for is that we have caught up with where the leader was the <i>previous</i> time
 * that we checked.
