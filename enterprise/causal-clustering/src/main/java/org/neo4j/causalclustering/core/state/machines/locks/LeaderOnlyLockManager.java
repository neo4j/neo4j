/**
 * Each member of the cluster uses its own {@link LeaderOnlyLockManager} which wraps a local {@link Locks} manager.
 * The validity of local lock managers is synchronized by using a token which gets requested by each server as necessary
 * and if the request is granted then the associated id can be used to identify a unique lock session in the cluster.
 * <p/>
 * The fundamental strategy is to only allow locks on the leader. This has the benefit of minimizing the synchronization
 * to only concern the single token but it also means that non-leaders should not even attempt to request the token or
 * significant churn of this single resource will lead to a high level of aborted transactions.
 * <p/>
 * The token requests carry a candidate id and they get ordered with respect to the transactions in the consensus
 * machinery.
 * The latest request which gets accepted (see {@link ReplicatedTransactionStateMachine}) defines the currently valid
 * lock session id in this ordering. Each transaction that uses locking gets marked with a lock session id that was
 * valid
 * at the time of acquiring it, but by the time a transaction commits it might no longer be valid, which in such case
 * would lead to the transaction being rejected and failed.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link ReplicatedLockTokenStateMachine} handles the token requests and considers only one to be valid at a time.
 * Meanwhile, {@link ReplicatedTransactionStateMachine} rejects any transactions that get committed under an
 * invalid token.
