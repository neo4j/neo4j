Neo4j - The World's Leading Graph Database
==========================================

*Neo4j is a high-performance, NOSQL graph database with all the features of a mature and robust database.* The programmer works with an object-oriented, flexible network structure rather than with strict and static tables — yet enjoys all the benefits of a fully transactional, enterprise-strength database. For many applications, Neo4j offers performance improvements on the order of 1000x or more compared to relational DBs.

Neo4j is an open source (you're reading it) project available in a GPLv3 Community edition, with Advanced and Enterprise editions available under both the AGPLv3 and commercial licenses, supported by [Neo Technology](http://neotechnology.com/).
