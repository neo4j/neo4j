This is the reference driver implementation for <a href="http://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>, it allows you to connect to a
Neo4j server and interact with it.
If you are using Java, this is generally the interface you'd use to integrate Neo4j in your application.


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To include this driver in your application project, you need to include it on your classpath.
    The driver is available in Maven Central, and can be included in regular Maven projects as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.neo4j.driver&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;neo4j-java-driver&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>


<h3>Getting Connected</h3>

<p>Once you have the driver and a connector on your classpath, you can establish a session with Neo4j.
    Below is a minimum viable snippet that establishes a session, creates a node, and queries for that node back.</p>

<pre><code>Session session = Neo4j.session( "neo4j+http://localhost:7687" );

    String statement = "CREATE (a {name:{n}}) RETURN a.name";
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters = Neo4j.parameters( "n", "Bob" );

    Result result = session.run( statement, parameters );
    while ( result.hasNext() )
    {
    Value row = result.next();
    System.out.println( row.get( "a.name" ) );
    }

    session.close();
</code></pre>


<h3>Dive into the Docs</h3>

Have a look at the <a href="org/neo4j/Neo4j.html" title="interface in org.neo4j"><code>Neo4j</code></a> class to get
started.


<h3>Design philosophy</h3>

<p>The main philosophy on which this driver is build is that <strong>the driver shouldn't get in the way</strong>.
    Generally this means designing for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">least
        amount of surprise</a>
    - but in some cases it means choosing a strong stance against routes that lead to surprising behavior later on.</p>
