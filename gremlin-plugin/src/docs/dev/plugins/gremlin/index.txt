Gremlin Plugin
==============

http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] is a Groovy based Graph Traversal Language. It provides a very expressive way of explicitly scripting traversals through a Neo4j graph.

The Neo4j Gremlin Plugin provides an endpoint to send Gremlin scripts to the Neo4j Server.
The scripts are executed on the server database and the results are returned as Neo4j Node and Relationship representations.
This keeps the types throughout the REST API consistent.
The results are quite verbose when returning Neo4j +Node+,
+Relationship+ or +Graph+ representations.
On the other hand, just return properties like in the <<rest-api-send-a-gremlin-script---json-encoded-with-table-results>>
example for responses tailored to specific needs.
