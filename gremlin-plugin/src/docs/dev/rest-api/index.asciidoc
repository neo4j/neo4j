Gremlin Plugin
==============

image::gremlin-logo.png[]

http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com[Gremlin] is a Groovy based Graph Traversal Language. It provides a very expressive way of explicitly scripting traversals through a Neo4j graph.

The Neo4j Gremlin Plugin provides an endpoint to send Gremlin scripts to the Neo4j Server.
The scripts are executed on the server database and the results are returned as Neo4j Node and Relationship representations.
This keeps the types throughout the REST API consistent.
The results are quite verbose when returning Neo4j +Node+,
+Relationship+ or +Graph+ representations.
On the other hand, just return properties like in the <<rest-api-send-a-gremlin-script---json-encoded-with-table-results>>
example for responses tailored to specific needs.

[WARNING]
The Gremlin plugin lets you execute arbitrary Groovy code under the hood. In hosted and open environments, this can constitute a security risk.
In these case, consider using declarative approaches like <<cypher-query-lang>> or write your own server side plugin executing the
interesting Gremlin or Java routines, see <<server-plugins>> or secure your server, see <<security-server>>.

[TIP]
When returning results from pipes like `g.v(0).in()`, make sure to iterate through the results in order not to return the pipe object but its content, like `g.v(0).in().iterate()`. For more caveats, see https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Troubleshooting[Gremlin Troubleshooting]
