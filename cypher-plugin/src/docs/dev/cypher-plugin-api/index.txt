Cypher Plugin
=============

WARNING: This functionality is now provided by the core REST API. 
The plugin will continue to work for some time, but is as of Neo4j 1.6 deprecated.
See <<rest-api-cypher>> for documentation on the built-in Cypher support.

The Neo4j Cypher Plugin enables querying with the <<cypher-query-lang>>.
The results are returned as a list of string headers (+columns+), and a +data+ part,
consisting of a list of all rows, every row consisting of a list of REST representations
of the field value - +Node+, +Relationship+ or any simple value like +String+.
