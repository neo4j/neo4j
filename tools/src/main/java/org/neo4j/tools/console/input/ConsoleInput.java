/**
 * Useful utility which listens to input from console and reacts to each line, i.e. after each ENTER.
 * {@link Command} are added with {@link #add(String, Command)} and are then reacted to in a separate thread,
 * which continuously sits and listens to console input.
 *
 * Use of this class can be a shell-like tool which boots up, instantiates a {@link ConsoleInput},
 * {@link #start() starts it} followed by {@link #waitFor()} which will block until the input stream ends
 * or an exit command is issued.
 *
 * Another use is to instantiate {@link ConsoleInput}, {@link #start() start it} and then move on to do
 * something else entirely. That way the commands added here will be available user input something in
 * the console while all other things are happening. In this case {@link #shutdown()} should be called
 * when the application otherwise shuts down.
